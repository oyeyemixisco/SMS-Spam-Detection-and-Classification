Madam,

This is to acknowledge the receipt of your mails and
Attached documents of prove. The documents were well
received and I would also like to inform you that this
chambers has carried out her investigations and
confirmation of your documents and beneficiary status
and found out that all the information you passed to
us was correct.

I checked the validity of your inheritance and found
out that Dr. Dredo Deposited these funds with A.D.B
some years ago with your name as his next of
kin/beneficiary of the deposited funds.

The director of the foreign deposit department of
A.D.B informed me that this funds would be sent to the
government as unclaimed before the end of this month
because, no individual has come up as a relative to
Dr. Dredo for the release of the funds. I then
presented the Death certificate of your late uncle to
him and he really sympathized for the death of their
prime customer Dr. Dredo.=20

I made it clear to him that I have been appointed by
your family to apply for the release of this
inheritance because you would not be able to make a
trip for final sign off ceremony and all documentation
from the relevant ministries.

Presently, I would have to file an application on your
behalf for the release of your inheritance and as soon
as it is approved which will take two to three banking
days, the bank will send you a letter of
acknowledgment and confirmation of your receiving Bank
account details where you would like your inheritance
to be swiftly transferred through our Reserve Bank
(Central Bank).

Before we can proceed with the applications, you would
be required by this chamber to make available the
professional service charge of this chamber for us to
commence immensely with the application process.

The official consultations and mobilization fees of
this humble chambers would have to be Ten thousand
five hundred united states dollars (USD 10,500.00) but
you would be required to make available 50% of the
official charge, Five thousand two hundred and fifty
United states dollars (USD 5,250.00) for our
commencement. The remaining balance of the service
charged would be paid upon the receipt and
confirmation of your inheritance into your receiving
bank account.=20

Upon the receipt of your confirmation and willingness
to make the payment, the modes of the payment would be
related to you.

You are welcomed to ask any question you feel very
important.

Help us to serve you better.

winners because of the insurance policy that covers your funds 
which does not allow any deduction until final credit of your 
money into your nominated Bank Account.

Upon your payment of this fee, we shall conclude the processing 
of your winning within 24hrs and send your claim file to the 
paying out Bank. Do send us your Bank information in your next 
mail, though the Bank will also contact you and demand it when 
we must've furnished them with the necessary documents regards 
to your winning.

We await your urgent response on this matter.

Best Regards,

This company declined reverse payment for these charges, stating 
that it is against their professional policy towards ensuring the 
safe delivery of the cheque to you. That if a reverse payment is 
made, and something goes wrong, that we/you cannot sue the courier 
company or insurance company to recover the full value of the fund 
as stipulated in the cheque since payment for insurance cover was 
not made at point of mailing.With the above reason, reverse payment 
is ruled out.

Note: that your prize is protected by a hardcover insurance policy, 
which makes it impossible to deduct any amount from the money before 
it has been remitted to you. This means that the above charges cannot 
be deducted from the prize and hence must be provided by you before 
your prize is transferred to you.

This is in accordance with section 13(1)(n) of the national gambling 
act as adopted in 1993 and amended on 3RD july 1996 by the constitutional 
assembly.This is to protect winners and to avoid misappropriation 
of funds

Send your response to indicate your option within the next 24hrs,because 
you only have 6 days to claim this cheque and after this period,your 
cash prize will be deemed to have been forfeited by you and will be

At first they are Mr. Moses Riew at: I directed you to contact ( )

when I took out an email to him. And I directed you to fill in a transmission of
a message form with all my personal data. It is my name, an address, a phone
number, a FAX number, an email address in the form that has been transmitted
afterwards. I made entry of banker name, my information of an international
passport, all the receipt methods of the prize money. I transmitted it. And an
answer came from Mrs Moor of Staners Agency. It was ordered to pay 800
euros in the next email for movement rate. I e-mailed it when I sent my check,
but it was introduced , CITADEL TRUST BV transport became impossible for
maintenance of a transportation company by the next email, and it was told by
the transportation company which was a client after having paid it when a bank
moved from that place. And is poetry Hara w for a tax of 4500 dollars
afterwards a powerful health insurance card sticks to this compensation, and to
move || was told unless it was it if kicked it. When CITADEL TRUST BV
furnished you with a loan of 5000 dollars when payment told that it was
impossible, I reported. However, I had to pay half the 2500 dollars to them.
Because it was moved by a platinum trust a subsidiary of CITADEL TRUST (
BV after having paid it, it was told that I accessed e-bank. And it was handed )
account information, but was not able to access e-bank. It was said that it was
not necessary to pay a tax anymore. However, the platinum trust was violated
by computer virus, and it was told that a remittance became impossible. And it
was introduced Midas Trust Group http://www.midastg.com which was a
subsidiary of a platinum trust. It was said that I used their e-bank, and it was
handed account information. With them, I tried start, but made a blunder. It was
told to pay 8500 euros for start rate.

"Dear Sir,

I am Mr Avis Ugomba Director of bills/exchange at the
foreign remittance department of North Atlantic Security
Compay Sarl here in Togo. In my department, I discovered an
abandoned sum of $30.5m (Thirty Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that
belonged to one Late MR LEVY SHIMONY an American, who died
along with his entire family, on 31th October 1999, in a
ghastly plane crash. Since we got the information about his
death, I have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over
and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we
can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next
of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our
Security guidelines.

Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this money.
It is based on this I decided to establish a cordial
business relationship with you, hence by contacting you.I
want you to present yourself as the next of kin to Late MR
LEVY SHIMONY, so that the funds can be remitted into your
account. Moreover,i do not want the money to go into the
government account as unclaimed bills. The Security law and
guidelines here stipulates that any account abandoned or is
dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all
money contained therein forfeited to the government
treasury account.

Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be
transferred into the government account as an unclaimed
fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of
2004, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason
for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact
that the deceased (Late MR LEVY SHIMONY) was a
foreigner, and I have access to his detailed bio data
which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the
next of kin to Late Mr Levy Shimony.

The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the
money into your account, shall be 60% to me and
for the role you will be expected to play in this deal,
I have agreed to give you 35% of the total sum and 5% for
the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties
in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are
expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and
interest to participate in this business. After receiving
your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact
steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall
contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable
us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or
hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly
confidential for security reasons considering my official
position in North Atlantic Security.

FROM:MR. CHEUNG PUI
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Sai Wan Ho Branch 
171 Shaukiwan Road
Hong Kong.


Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion for you.

Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him,even during the war. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his ba! nk deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim
it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds. 

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me! with your Full
Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the
funds to an account that will be provided by you.

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. 

Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 80% for me, 20% for you . Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefers you to reach me on the email address below (pui001@investment-world.net ) 


and finally after that I shall provide you with more details ! of this operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be

Korea. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
I am the Auditing officer to Mrs Salah Adams (deceased) one of our foreign
customers. While she banked with us, I oversaw her
accounts and other official/financial obligations as my office demanded
being her auditor.Unfortunately, he died along with her entire family in
the plane crash of 31 October, 1999 on board the Egyptian Airline 990
alonside other passengers. On further investigation, I found out that she
died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Salah
Adams did not declare any kin or relations in all her official
documents,including her Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$45,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal
sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to Laws of Republic of South Korea, at the expiration of 5
(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korean
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.I cannot release the fund
from her account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin to Mrs. Salah Adams so that the fruits of this old
woman's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address
so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the
services of our bank attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL
and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favor for the
transfer.

Having made a very frantic and exhaustive search for any family member
that would lay claim to this fund, I decided to take my chance with you.I
now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the deceased
as I have all documentations including his certified Death Certificate
that will facilitate your stand as next of kin to her as she had a closing
balanced of US$45,000,000.00 here in our bank in South Korea.

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual
business endeavour by furnishing me with the following;
1. Beneficiary name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
These requirements will enable me make some internal re-adjustments and
file your name in form A2, T12 and other vital forms as next of kin.

African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.Sean Powell made a 
numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$26,500,000.00,(Twenty-six Million, five hundred thousand 
Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we 
discovered from his contract employers, the National Petroleum 
Corporation that Mr.Sean Poewll died from an
automobile accident.

On further investigation,I found out that he diedwithout making a WILL, 
and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore 
made further investigation anddiscovered that Mr.Sean Powell did not 
declare any or relations in all his official documents,including his 
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has 
carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping.No one will ever come 
forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration 
of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the 
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to 
stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my 
bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a 
foreign account.
 
I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to 
claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you 
to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney 
will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the 
beneficiary of the funds.
The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me 
and 20% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the 
Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this 
transaction.
 
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon 
your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant 
documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this 
transaction would be most
profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to 
invest my share in real estate within your country.

Mr. Jun Cheng,
Bank Of Korea,
16-1, Yoido-dong, 
Youngdungpo-gu, 
Seoul 150-873.

Dear Friend
         I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the  foreign
remittance department of Hanivitbank. In my department, we  discovered
an  abandoned sum of $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one
Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire
family, on November  1998, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the
information about his death,  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to
come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can
not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or
relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.
          Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this  money.
It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have
decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you, hence by
contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to
Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your
account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government
account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here
stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of
years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the
government treasury account.
            Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be
transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or
before the end of this financial quarter of 2005, when nobody come
forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is
occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was
a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will
hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr
Andrew Phillips.
          The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money
into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you
will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of
the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the
two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are
expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to
participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be
communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent
response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this
matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay
or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential
for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.
Personal Regards,
Mr. Jun Cheng

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your

I will introduce myself as Jeffrey N.Edwards, a staff in the
accounts management section of the above firm here in the
United Kingdom.
One of our accounts with holding balance of
£15,000,000(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant
and has not been operated for the past four (4) years.
From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this
account, a foreigner by name Kurt Kahle died in July, 2000 see this
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
and since then nobody has done anything as regards the
claiming of this money because he has no family members who
are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds.
I have secretly discussed this matter with a senior official
of this company and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign
partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you,
standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the
deceased and funds released to you after due processes have
been followed.
This transaction is totally free of risk and as the fund is
legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry,
terrorism or any other illegal act. On receipt of your
response I will furnish you with detailed clarification as it
relates to this mutual benefit transaction.

My name is Catherine Jennings I work with the Private Banking Division
At Berkeley Bank Limited, London. We are conducting a standard
process investigation in relation to matters involving a client who
shares the same name as yours (Kessler) and also the circumstances
surrounding investments made by this client at our bank.

Our Berkeley Banking client died intestate and nominated no next of
kin to inherit the title over the investments made with our bank.

The essence of this communication with you is to request you provide us
information on three issues:

1-Are you aware of any relative/relation who shares your same name
whose last known contact address was in Brussels ?

2-Are you aware of any investment of considerable value made by such a
person at the Private Banking Division of Berkeley Bank?

3-Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt your eligibility to assume
status of next of kin to the deceased?

It is pertinent that you inform us ASAP whether or not you are familiar
With this individual that we may put an end to this communication with
you and our inquiries surrounding this person.

You must appreciate that we are constrained from providing you with
More detailed information at this point. Please respond to this mail as
soon as possible to afford us the opportunity to close this
investigation.

Subject: Kessler Victimsurname

Victimfirstname,
I am Thomas Masters, an associate to Mrs. Cathy Jennings who contacted you earlier concerning Mr.Kessler Victimsurname and an investment placed under our banks management 2 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. 
In 2004, Kessler came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million Pounds, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case, I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. 
I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million Pounds, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. 
In mid 2005, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Antwerp. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm here in the U.K. I informed him that Berkeley would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. 
A cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and had the funds available in main land Europe. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at a security consultancy firm, Leadenhall Financial. 
Leadenhall Financial is an especially private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In Line with instructions, the money was deposited with Leadenhall Financial. Kessler told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that year. This week was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th February 2005. 
In January this year, we got a call from Leadenhall Financial informing us that the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Leadenhall Financial, and I could not understand why Kessler had not come forward to claim his deposit. 
I then made futile efforts to locate Kessler. I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of Berkeley. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently Kessler was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cane, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. 
The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank even gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. 
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; Kessler died in testate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. 
It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. You have unfortunately declared that you are in no way affiliated with this individual. What this means, you being the last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. 
According to practice, Leadenhall Financial will by the end of this year broadcast a request for statements of claim to Berkeley, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to Berkeley. This will result in the money entering the Berkeley accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. 
This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who sit upon certain chairs and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. 
There is 8,370,000.00 Pounds deposited at Leadenhall financial, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Berkeley is concerned, the transaction with Kessler concluded when I sent the funds to Leadenhall Financial, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Leadenhall Financial has not a single idea of what’s the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that I may direct. This is the situation. 
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man’s family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared to instruct Leadenhall Financial to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50. 
I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement with claiming the deposit. But on the other hand, you with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with right to claim. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to Kessler I will then officially communicate with Leadenhall Financial and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have Leadenhall Financial direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from Leadenhall Financials. It is not a conventional financial institution; they accept deposits from only organizations thus; what you hand over to them is what you get back. They do not have the means to process the money. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. 
You may not know this but people like myself who have made a tidy sum out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances won’t pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the centre of relevance in my life. Let’s share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. 
If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines. For now contact me only through this email address. 
I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. I await your response.

Please endeavour to use it for children of God. with warm hearts I offer my
friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It
will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know
me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity from
God. My name is Mrs. Roseline Gupta. from Malaysia. I am married to Dr james Gupta
who worked with the Malaysia embassy in South Africa for nine years, Before he
died in 2002.

We were married for eleven years without a child.He died after a brief illness
that lasted for four days. Before his death we were both born again
christains.Since his death i decided not to remarry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible spoke against.When my husband was alife he
deposited the sum of $22million US dollars [twenty two million US dollars] with
a finance company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the a security
company in europe. Resently my doctor told me that i will take the grace of GOD
for me to live one year more due to cancer problems.

Though what disturbs me mostly is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided
to donate this fund to church or still a christain individual that will use this
to fund churches, orphanages and widows and also propagating the word of God and
to ensure that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed are the hands that giveth. I took
this decision because I don`t have any child that will inherit this money and my
husband's relatives are not christains and I don`t want my husband hard earned
money to be misused by unbelievers. I don`t want a situation where these money
will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold
decision. I am not afraid of death hence i know where am going.

I know that am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14vs14 says that
the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I can only communication
with you via email because of my health I cant always call you because of my
health and my inlaws around me but I will always try if chance permits me. I
don`t want them to know about these development.

Although I can do all things through christ that empowers me. As soon as I
recieve your reply I shall give you the contact of the security Company in
Europe. I will also fax to you all the deposit document and a letter of
authority that will enpower you as the original- Beneficiary of this fund. I
want you and the church to always pray for me.

My happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy christain, whoever that wants to
serve the Lord must serve Him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful
all through your life.

Thanks for your cooperation.

RE: PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.


I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years, before he died in the year 2000.We were both married for eleven years without a child.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is all against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.6Million (Eighteen Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with a finance/security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company in Europe for safe keeping. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem.

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition of health I have decided to donate this fund to churches, orphanage or a better Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.

I am married to Usman Ismiana of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait
embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief
illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very 
devoted Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both 
cancer and fibroid problems when my late husband was alive he deposited 
the sum of $15million dollars (FIFTEEN million dollars) with an overseas 
finance and security firm. Presently,this money is still with finance 
and security firm. 
Recently,my doctor told me that I had a terminating illness (cancer) 
that would last for the next four months.Though what disturbs me most 
is my stroke sickness, having known my condition I decided to donate this 
fund to either a Christian organization or a devoted Christian individual 
that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.

I want this Christian organization or individual to use this money in 
all sincerity to fund churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the 
word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of 
the holy bible.The holy bible emphasized so much on the giving of 
alms,charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold step.
I took this decision because I don't have any child to start from and 
where I will stop and my husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't
want my husband hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an
unbeliever.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in 
an unholy manner hence the reason for taking this bold decision.
I know that after death I will be with God the most high and the
most merciful one.I don't need any telephone communications but will 
only give you the contact of my lawyer Barr Brown Nelson because 
he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the 
beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm.

With God,I know that all thing are possible and as soon as I receive 
your reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the
beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take before
receiving these funds and I shall also give you the contact of the 
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of authority that will
prove you as the original beneficiary of the funds.
I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for me.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian though married 
to a Muslim, whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in spirit,
please always be prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your 
reply will give me room in sourcing for another Christian organization or a 
devoted Christian for the same purpose.Until I hear from you my dreams will 
rest squarely on your shoulders,may the Almighty God continue to guide and protect
you Amen.

Mrs. Joy Dish Khushab


I am Mrs. Joy Dish Khushab,a Egypt national I was
married to Dr.Dish Khushab who worked with Egypt
embassy in China for nine years before he died in the
year 2001.We were married for twive years and the
union unfortunately did not produce any offspring.
Before his death we had given our lives to Christ and
were living according to the Word.
A few weeks ago i was diagnosed with cancer and the
doctor has informed me that i do not have much time to
live. Presently I am practically an invalid as the
cancer has ravaged my body and i can feel my life
slowly ebbing away. I do not have much time to do the
Lord's work but He will give me strength to see my
last assignment through.
My husband, Dr .Khushab before his death deposited his
life savings of approximately Sixty Million 
Five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars with a financial 
institution in the European continent. Before his death, 
we were committed to the growth of the church and the 
propagation of the word, but I can no longer partake 
in these noble tasks. I need a church,Christian individual 
or individuals who can continue the work in our stead. 
who will utilize this money theway I am going to instruct 
here into-fund churches,orphanages and widows propagating 
the word of God andto ensure that the house of God is maintained. 
To care for the sick, the poor, the downtrodden wherever they
may be The Bible made us to understand that blessed is

the hand that gives. I took this decision because
I don'thave any child or next of kin who can inherit
these monies.
Though the internet is a seemingly unlikely
place to find such individuals, I believe that the
Lord hide s jewels in the most unlikely places. It is
not the means that is important but the message.
I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the
Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my
case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things
are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall
give you the contact of financial institution in
Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority
that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of
this fund. I want you and the church to always pray
for me because the lord is my shepherd. Happiness is
that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I
stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you. Remain
blessed in the name of the Lord.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs. Joy Dish Khushab

Assalamo Alaykom.

Wasalaam to you,and how are you doing?. My intention
of contacting you is to solicit your assistance for a
project which will be mutually
beneficial.Though I know my decision to contact you is
to a large extent unconventional, the prevailing
circumstances necessitated my action. 
I am Hajia Zainab Abdulkarim  from Libya. I am married
to Late Mallam OSMAN ABDULKARIM of blessed memory was
an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years
before he died in the year 2000. We were married for
twelve years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for only four days. Before his
death we were both devoted Muslims. Since his death I
too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid
problems. When my late Husband was alive he made a
huge deposit in millions of US dollars with a Deposit
Company in oversea. (I will tell you the amount as we
proceed).

Recently, my doctor told me that I have only six
months to live due to cancer problem. Though what
disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known
my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a
Muslem organization or devoted Muslim individual that
will utilize this money the way I am going to
instructs herein. I want this Muslim organization or
individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund
mosques, orphanages, widows, and also propagating the
word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds
the views and belief of the Holy Quran.
 
The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S
benevolence and this has encourage me to take the bold
step. I took this decision because I don't have any
child that will inherit this money and my husband
relatives are into some radical organisations and I
don't want a situation where this money will be used
in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this bold
decision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH
the most beneficent and the most merciful. 

I don't need any telephone communication in this
regard because of my health, because of the presence
of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't
want them to know about this development. With ALLAH
all things are possible. As soon as I receive your
reply on Email: hajiaZainab@islamicvice.com I shall give
you the contact information of the Deposit Company in
oversea where the money was deposited. I will also
issue a letter of authority to the Deposit Company
authorizing them that the said fund Have being willed
to you and a copy of such authorization will be
forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community
where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness
is that I lived a true devoted Muslims worthy of
emulation. Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must
serve him in truth and in fairness. I will not
stipulate any precise amount to reward you as it will
have to be on pre-negotiated terms,based on your level
of involvment.

Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any
delay in your reply will give room in sourcing for a
Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for this same
purpose. Until I hear from you email my dreams will
rest squarely on your shoulders. 
May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and protect
you.

Subject: AM JUST BACK FROM COURT FirstName 
To: victimemailaddress

    Attention: FirstName,
 
Thanks FirstName, do have in mind that Mother Rose Smith has been a very nice woman to me and my family and have in fact helped children all over Africa when she was Ok, and that is another reason why I want to help her anyway I can.
I am a very serious person and assure you of the possibility of these funds, that is why I am afraid Mother Rose has to be careful and you must assure me that you will not let her done.
I have visit the Federal High Court to verified for how much it will cost to get an approved Change of Ownership, have in mind that I will be the one to draft a Power of attorney making you the beneficiary, but we will need an approval from the Federal High Court which I have verified on and they have stated that it will cost us USD$ 1,650.As I told you .
 
Consequent to this, I want you and Mother Rose Smith to know that I am ready to assist in which ever way I can, and that is why I have left everything I have doing and have contacted the Federal high court to know how much this will cost us, and as I know this Change of Ownership is the only thing holding the progress of this transaction and the release of the funds to you, because before Mother Rose late husband died this same process was made, and the Change of Ownership was approved before Mother Rose smith was made the beneficiary of the funds in question.
I assure you and confirm the availability of this funds, and that is why I am ready to assist in which ever way I can, and have agreed to assist with USD$ 700, because I know Mother Rose is in the hospital and does not have access to cash, as all her hospital bills have been paid for in advance.
My dear I want you to know that mother Rose is a very nice person and surely we will benefit from this transaction from what she will offer us, after taking care of the motherless as she have always stated.
So now try you best possible let’s join hands like one to make this dying woman’s dreams come to pass, Ok? And that is another reason why I have agreed to assist with what I can raise.
Also have in mind that for the process of this document I will need your full name so as to attach to the document as the beneficiary of these funds.
My dear it is important you try and raise USD$ 950 remaining so that we can get the approval of this document, Ok? because I know with out this Change of Ownership document, there is no way progress can be made, as it is like an agreement between you Mother Rose and the Government of Nigeria, making you the new owner of the funds, so I want you to know that when this document is approved in your name, you will be made the beneficiary and will have access to the funds to complete this woman's wish.
For the quick obtaining of this document I will advice you send the balance of USD$ 950 via Western Union Money Transfer with the details as stated below.
 
RECEIVERS NAME: MR. KENNETH ARINZE ONWUDIWE
ADDRESS: 20 BODE THOMAS STREET. LAGOS-NIGERIA
TEST QUESTION: TO WHOM
TEST ANSWER: TO MY FRIEND
 
I expect the ten-digit control number along with the senders name for the possibility of receiving the funds.
I assure you that the document will be processed and obtained within 24 hours as I was advised in the high court. 
Please let her know I am doing my best here, and also remember that my USD$ 700 will be replaced after you have received Mother Rose funds in your hands.

"Dear VICTIMNAME, 
 
I write to advice you based on my discussion with the Administrative officer at the bank this morning when I informed him of her demise.

You must be already aware of the high rise in money laundering and terrorist activities in the world today which has brought about strict scrutiny and investigations by monetary bodies especially of financial transactions involving such huge sums both locally and internationally.

In a bid to ensure the success of this transaction, I decided to inquire from the bank as to the most convenient and fast way to transfer the 20,000,000.00 GBP from Lady Toreth Hughes' account to you now that she is dead.

The administrative officer stated that you open a fresh account in your name with the bank, so that the transfer would be seen as an in-house transfer and as such would not attract the attention of strict monetary bodies that supervises the transfer of funds internationally.

So that once the account has been successfully opened and activated, then the funds can easily be transferred to your account with the bank within the 24 hours.

In this regard I want you to contact the bank as soon as possible and open a new account in your name, afterwards the funds would be transferred hitch free to the new account in your name.

Here are the contact details of the bank.
Email: swissequitorial@london.com
 Tel: +44709 465 6859
        +44709 466 1201
Contact: Ms. Rachael Woods.

Send a copy of your mail to the bank to me too, do well to inform me once you have successfully opened the account so that we may proceed with the transfer.

I hope that I have informed you correctly and I expect that you would act exactly as directed.

PLEASE ENSURE THAT THIS IS KEPT PERSONAL BECAUSE OF THE STRICT CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH MY CLIENT DEMANDED.

"Hello Dearest Firstname,
I am more than happy in your reply to my mail.
How are you this morning? How was your night hope fine.?.
Mine is a little bit hot over here in Dakar Senegal.
In this camp we are only allowed to go out only on mondays and fridays of 
the weeks.Its just like one staying in the prison and i hope by Gods grace i will come out here soon.We don't have any relatives now whom we can go to all our relatives ran away in the middle of the war the only person we have now is Rev.Emmanuel George  who is the pastor of the (Christ for all Churches) here in the camp he has been very nice to me since i came here but i am not living with him rather i am leaving in the women's hostel because the camp have two hostels one for men the other for women.
The Pastors Tel number is (+221-608-70-30) if you call and tell him that you want to speak with me he will send for me in the hostel. As a refugee here i don't have any right or privilledge to any thing be it money or whatever because it is against the law of this country.I want to go back to my studies because i only attended my first year before the traggic incident that lead to my being in this situation now took place.
Please listen to this,i have my late father's statement of account and death certificate here with me which i will send to you latter,because when he was alive he deposited some amount of money in a leading bank in Europe which he used my name as the next of kin,the amount in question is $9.7M(Nine Million seven Hundred Thousand Dollars).
So i will like you to help me transfer this money to your account and from it you can send some money for me to get my travelling documents and air ticket to come over to meet with you.I kept this secret to people in the camp here the only person that knows about it is the Revrend because he is like a father to me.
So in the light of above i will like you to keep it to  yourself and don't tell it to anyone for i am afraid of loosing my life and the money if people gets to know about it.
Remember i am giving you all this information due to the trust i deposed on you.I like honest and understanding people,truthful and a man of vision,truth and hardworking.
My favourite language is english but our language is french but i speak english very fluently.Meanwhile i will like you to call me like i said i have alot to tell you.
Have a nice day and think about me.

Dearest ,
How are you getting on?.I do hope that you are catching up with 
the goodies of the day in full.Mine here is very hot and like you 
know we are living in the refugee camp here in Dakar Senegal.In 
this camp we are only allowed to go out only on mondays and fridays 
of the weeks. 
Its just like one staying in the prison and i hope by Gods grace 
i will come out here soon.We don't have any relatives now whom we 
can go to all our  relatives ran away in the middle of the war the 
only person we have now is REV.  emmaunel george who is the pastor 
of the (Christ for all Churchs ) here in  the camp he has been very 
nice to me since i came here but i am not living with him rather i 
am leaving in the women's hostel because the camp  have two hostels 
one for men the other for women. The Pastors Tel number is 
(00221-608-70-30) if you call and tell him that you want to speak 
with me he will send for me in the hostel. As a refugee here i don't 
have any right or privilledge to any thing be it money or whatever 
because it is against the law of this country.I want to go back to 
my studies because i only attended my first year before the traggic
incident that lead to my being in this situation now took place.
Please listen to this,i have my late father's statement of account 
and death certificate here with me which i will send to you latter,
because when he was alive he deposited some amount of money in a 
leading bank in Europe which he used my name as the next of kin,
the amount in question is $9.7M(Nine  Million seven Hundred Thousand Dollars).
So i will like you to help me transfer this money to your account 
and from it you can send some money for me to get my travelling 
documents and  air ticket to come over to meet with you.I kept this 
secret to people in  the camp here the only person that knows about 
it is the Revrend because he is like a father to me. So in the 
light of above i will like you to keep it to yourself and don't 
tell it to anyone for i am afraid of loosing my life and the money 
if people gets to know about it.Remember i am giving you all this 
information dueto the trust i deposed on you.I like honest and 
understanding people,truthful and a man of vision,truth and hardworking.
My favourite language is english but our language is french but i 
speak english very fluently.Meanwhile i will like you to call me 
like i said  i have alot to tell you.Have a nice day and think
about me.Awaiting to hear from you soonest

"My Dearest Firstname,
 
I thank you for your kindit reply, it is my previlegde to have 
you as my husband  and be the mother of your childrens or as a 
partner if only you will be honest with me in this matter.

It was like a dream coming true, when i received your letter today 
that you sincerely want to help me. I am happy to know a man that 
is honest and sincere like you. You have changed my days and my 
life today.However, i wish to give you detail explanation on the 
letter that i sent to you.  I lost my mother and junior ones 
during the war while i came to Senegal with daddy who is dead now.


Thanks for your word, love and everything.I will surely print out 
your full photograph and put it in my album when i have it.


Thanks for the short letter and kindid response, I am an undergraduate 
student at American Suffolk University here in Dakar with scholarship 
by Catholic Missions  since the war in  Liberia and  just about 
22 years old.

I have meet a lawyer and explained all these matter to him and i 
wish to explain in detail the transfer and withdrawal of the money, 
which is the only thing that may hold me down here before i visit you.

But if you want me to meet you before this issue of  the money i 
will do so, if you can help on my invitation letter and others. i 
will also like to receive some information about you.


The main reason why I am contacting you now is to seek your assistance 
in the area of my future investment and also for a help hand over some 
huge amount of money in my possession. This money (US10 Million dollars)
is deposited in a security and finance company  some years ago by my 
father, he made me the sole beneficiary .

 I am now asking you to stand on my behalf as my partner and in time 
to the claim and investment as well, because i have seen that you have 
the fear of God in you. I have made up my mind to offer you 25% of the 
total money while the remaining will go into a productive investment. 
As I have mention earlier I will make the procedure to this issue to be 
well known to you, if I am given the opportunity to do so. 
 
I printed your letter and later discussed the matter with a lawyer 
barrister Ken Iwuogo of Ken Iwougo chambers whom the Securities manager 
advised me to contact to monitor the transfer of this money and the 
lawyer Ken agreed that you can help me.


I want you to know that the money is with Sagam Trust Securities Plc 
Dakar Senegal. and it is going to be transfered to you in a legal manner 
and this is why i have to invite this lawyer to help us in all ways.

The lawyer will need your full names, registered address and passport 
number or driving licence number or your id card number to prepare 
agreement and also for the validation and notarisation of the agreement 
paper in the high court here in Dakar Senegal for the legal transfer of 
the money into your account without risk.

I will give you the full contacts of Sagam Trust Securities with the 
detail of my father's Trust account last statement with the death 
certificate of my father and th ey will tell you how to transfer this 
money to your bank account.


please my dear send to me your, phone number, register address, your, 
full picture, full names, passport or national identity number or 
driving licence number.


So also we will discuss about my visit to you soon.

Finally, as soon as I receive the information from you; I will give you 
the contact details of the Securities companies and the drafted letter 
by a lawyer that you will send to the Securities Companies for 
confirmation and procedures for the transfer.

Please  include your full names,picture, and passport number in your 
reply to this letter.

"Hello, 

A relative of Rafiu Otono happens to be one of my Clients and the said 
person has his name related to scam issues in your site. This is an 
issue that has just come to my knowledge and i would like to have a 
concrete information on the issue. 

Now if at all this Rafiu is related, i would like a proof of his 
relationship with the said crime as i know that a corporation with 
your integrity will not post implicating files on-line without a prove 
of those crimes. I have been assigned by my client to investigate on 
the issue. I will be of immense help in providing any valuable document 
in my possession to you.

Please, your reply is earnestly expected as this issue has eaten deep 
into the family of my Client.

Sincerely,

Barrister Alade

First I must thank you for picking up the consideration to be our agent via our costumers who are already and able to pay some of our outstanding bills.

Surprise to say that your role in this endeavour is to serve as our agent to get to our customers who has been indebted to us over a considerable lenght of time and help stand as an agent through which they will make such payments to us.

Your reward for helping us collect such an outstanding debt will be 5% of whatever money that is being paid to our Company through your Account. 

You will be given adequate coordinates and banking instructions through which you will remit our balance 95% from your Account to us.

Please be advised that we will have to begin the necessary process of approving you as our
agent/partner on our receipt of your understanding, transparency, honesty and your sincere
abilities.

The main reason why we are sourcing for your help as our Agent is because we are currently having tax problems with the government and as a result all our Company Accounts worldwide are under strict watch and scrutiny, based on an unecessarily high progressive taxation rate which is politically motivated by masterminds in the government which our Company has fallen out of favour with.

On our receipt of your understanding/mail we will need some vital information from you that will enable us legitimise the process of this transaction, by drafting a Power of Appointment creating an Agency for the relationship of a Principal and Agent, also stating your benefits by way of Fiduciary gains or commission for your Fiduciary services.

Please send down the needed information;
Company name as a legal entity or your personal name acting in your personal capacity in the eyes of the law.

Contact Address, email address and tel/fax numbers.
Age, occupation and position in the Company (if you belong to a company).
A valid mode of Identification (e.g Drivers License, passport etc.)

valid form of identification to you.

Note: Endeavour to indicate your reference number as above in all of your correspondence with us. I await your immediate response and a customer will soon make payment through you to us.

"Mr.Andrew Van.
St James's Corporate Services Limited
6 St James's Place
London SW1A 1NP
United Kingdom

BE MY BUSINESS PARTNER 

It is my wish to contact and establish a strong business relationship with
you. I am Mr.Andrew Van Sales Representative in London, of Gold Field Company
South Africa.In respect of my position in the company, I personally succeeded
in establishing business contacts in USA and Canada to supply quantities
of Gold Dusts every month valued at 45 ? 50,000 United States Dollar . This
is a very private arrangement with no risk involved.

However, I am finding it very difficult receiving payment for the supplies
made 1-month ago before going further with the business. This is because
according to the new goverment financial regulation here, senior employees
in the company are prohibited from operating a private foreign account. Therefore,
I do not have a foreign account to receive the payment here in London and
this is where I need your help. Now, I want you to act as my agent by receiving
this Money in your account and forwarding same to me. Your commission will
be 10% of any money received on my behalf by you. The sales and payment will
continue as soon as I receive the payment of the supply made last month successfully
through your help.
 
If this proposal is acceptable to you, I need you to understand that this
is a private arrangement and I look forward to a business partnership with
you based on trust, confidentiality and mutual interest. I sincerely hope
you'll not take undue advantage of the trust I'll bestow on you.

VERY IMPORTANT:
I'll not at any stage of my business relationship with you, request that
you cover any expenses concerning the deal. Your role is basically to collect
funds on my behalf, subtract your commission of 10% and then send the balance
to me. Upon reciept of your mail, I'll send an agreement that will provide
the basis for our business relationship. Thanks for your envisaged assistance.

I await your urgent mail.

recently we were (engaged) contracted to supply cocoa,
and dried natural rubber to tire manufacturing
companies in Peru, US and Europe, which was
successfully done.
However, in as much as we able to successfully carry
out these supplies,we experience difficulty remitting
our proceeds from the sale of these products home. 
This is due to the fact that the fiscal policy in
my country is very stringent and not favorable. Small
firms like ours are not allowed before six months of
operation, to open and operate a domiciliary account
in foreign currencies abroad through which we would
have been able to remit our proceeds home. To this end
we seek a foreign company or individuals who we can
nominate as our partners to receive our payments in
their business/individual accounts on our behalf and
in turn send the money directly to us.
Thus we are willing to pay the individual or company
5% of the total sum for their assistance. This 5% will
not be a loss to us instead we hope to incorporate
these costs in our future charges to our prospective
customers overseas.
Currently we are not able to bring back home our funds
totaling USD98, 801.00(ninety eight thousand, eight
hundred and one dollars) in Peru, US and Europe
from export we just made. We therefore solicit your
assistance to help receive these payments through your
account on our behalf so that we can instruct
our customers to remit these monies directly to your
account, or alternatively the checks will be mailed to
you. We also require that you send us urgently
your telephone and fax numbers for proper
communication prior to any transaction.
We are also hoping to build a long time business
relationship with you should you be interested. Once
we have built our trust on you, we will continue
to straighten the business relationship. We hope you
can be of assistance to our company. We are very much
aware of various scams going on all over,and as such
we are assuring you that at no time will you be
required to pay or transfer funds that you have not
received from our customers to us.
We are sincerely a legitimate entrepreneur seeking for
a trustworthy foreign partner.

"My name is Paul Baker and I am an artist.I live in
United Kingdom,with my two kids, four cats, one dog and the love
of my life. It is definitely a full house. I have been doing
artwork since I was a small child. That gives me about 23
years of experience. I majored in art in high school and
took a few college art courses. Most of my work is done in
either pencil or airbrush mixed with color pencils. I have
recently added designing and creating artwork on the
computer.I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and
have had my work featured on trading cards, prints and in
magazines.I have sold in galleries and to private collectors
from all around the world.I am always facing serious
difficulties when it comes to selling my art works to
Americans,they are always offering to pay with a US POSTAL
MONEY ORDER,which is difficult for me to cash here in
United Kingdom.

 I am looking for a representative in the states who will be
working for me as a partime worker and i will be willing to
pay %10 for every transaction,which wouldnt affect ur
present state of work,someone who would help me recieve
payments from my customers in the states.i mean someone that
is responsible and reliable,cause the cost of coming to the
state and getting payments is very expensive,i am working on
setting up a branch in the states,so for now i need a
representative in the united states who will be handling the
payment aspect.

These payments are in money order and they would come to you
in your name, so all you need do is cash the money order
deduct your percentage and wire the rest back.

But the problem i have is trust,But i have my way of getting
anyone that gets away with our money,i mean the FBI branch
in Washington gets involved.

It wouldnt cost u any amount,u are to receive payments which
will be sent to u by fedex or usps from my business patners,
which would come in form of a money order then u are to cash
it and send the cash to me via western union money transfer or
moneygram money transfer,all transfer fees should be deducted
from the money.

If you are interested,please get back to me as soon as
possible.

"Hello my new friend, 
Compliment of the season, and a happy get-together with Vivan Reagan, I am 25yrs old girl leaving in Tukwila Washington. Let not race or nationality inch your mind, for this has being the key mother of the day. I decided having you as a pen pal friend knowing fully well that is an act of one expressing or sharing view with another or people around the world, which has to do with honesty, above all faithfulness. Freindship is like swallowing hot chocolate before it has cooled off. It takes you by surprise at first, but keeps you warm for a long time. Yes,friends are like stars;some afar and others around,but just need a favourite one.My dear,guess you could make my favorite. Reach me faster for a better talk through :- vivan_reagan4love@yahoo.com My regards to all your folks. Have a blissful moment and do keep in touch. In fact i will be travelling to Africa by MARCH, as a member of the organizing comittee of a combined conferences for RACISM and CHILD ABUSE taking place in the U.S first on the 20th to 23th MARCH,2006 at the Conference Hall Center St Lucie Orlando Florida State. and later in GUINEA-BISSAU(West Africa) on the 26th to 30th MARCH 2006. 
Thanks Vivan,U.S.A.",0,0,1,0,0
"Hello, 
       Thanks for your letter,first let me say compliment of the season to you. Sometimes, life certainly can feel that way.... and what better shelter from the storms and trials of daily life than friendship and to know that there is someone out there you can fall back on. Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but when you lock eyes with them, you know that every moment they will affect your life in some profound way.And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless-the people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience can create who you are, and the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. So if you're seriously looking for a friend to get to know,You have found me. I am glad to meet you too. Like as I have already informed you in my previous letter about my job.I am Living alone at my own apartment given to me by my father. I am the First child of my parents. My parent have three children, two girls and a boy by name  DAVID as the Last child,  JENNY is second to me .The name of my father's is  REAGAN LIN and my mother's name is JULIET REAGAN LIN .My father is an ex- diplomat to the United Nations while my mother is one of the senior personal of US department of education New york. I am single and haven,t marry once. My hobbies are reading,watching movies, listening to soft musics, long driving, swiming and travelling.I hate delay, that is slugglishness and procrastinating, I hate lies. I love some one who is trustworthy and does not smoke nor drink.I love nature and sometimes I wish I owened a house in the country not far from a city.You wake up to fresh mountain air,gaze the green senery,see green veges growing in your little garden and so much more. Kind of boring right? No, imagine I am with my sweetheart in those quite surroundings.well,I leave it to your own imagination what will hapen Some times I am always busy with the job activities during the Refugee resettlement program.I have travelled to many countries arround the globe in our course of visiting some refugee camps in other countries .I will be attending a combined conference in Africa by MARCH 2006. The conference is scheduled to hold in US first and follow by the one in Africa. I am one of the organisers of the forth coming youth combined conferences taking place in the US from MARCH 20th to 23th of MARCH and in Guine-Bissau,West Africa from MARCH 26th to 30th of MARCH,2006.  We are inviting five delegates from each the selected countries arround the world. In our request to invite youths from the selected countries, I went in search of e-mail on the website as a means of contacting youths and organisations in these countries . I picked your e-mail from a penpal website. You will assist us in relating to one of the existing youths organisation in your country to contact the conference secretariat in the US through this fax +01-253-648-0430 or through this e- mail, (yworeg2006@florida.usa.com )But before they could be considered for participation in this most esteemed event, their organisation will have to forward to the above address the following requirement. (1) The organisation profile (2) The Aims and Objectives of the organisation (3) Their achievements so far. With this information put into consideration by the organising committee , They will be officially invited to participate in this .Our independent donor will take care of all their flight tickets and their accommodation throught their stay in the US and the organising committee will process the US visa for all participants requiring entry visas to the US . Participants will only take care of their accommodation during the other event in Guine-Bissau. As one of the organisers I knew not of anybody from your country. Hence my writing to you is to gain assess to any youth organisation in your country. If you are interested to participate and wants to represent your country, you should contact the secretary to the organiser for detail information on registration procedures and inform the organiser that I recommended you.You will need not to forward the above requirement for your group or organisation , hence I will give your recommedation to the secretary.You are to contact the organiser as soon as possible as all participants visa request will be forwarded to the US Bureau of Immigrant Affairs for Authorisation the same.

      Hi,It is not my intention to praise myself
but, I just tried to explain my behaviours,
generally am an open minded, religious, mercyful,
loyal, and above all, respect mankind. Currently am
single and am looking for friendship or more. Am
interested in meeting someone with the same
qualities. Peace and love everywhere. Am waiting to
here from you.  I'm a friendly, down-to-earth,
non-conformist female,age 26, with a good sense of
humour, who is hoping to make a few new friends
around the globe. I`d love to hear from people with
some what similar interests,  I love to hear from
people down there in AFRICA, EUROPE as well as ASIA,
though all are welcome! Ideally, I am looking for
genuine long lasting friendship in which we can be
ourselves. I guess I'm looking for a friend who is
willing not only to share the everyday stuff that
goes on in their lives (both good and bad), but
their thoughts, feelings, and ideas too. I'd like to
think of myself as being very open-minded to varying
 opinions and beliefs and have been told by friends
that I'm a good listener. Please, NO prisoners,
chain or religious mail,  I do apologize for the
restrictions, but I've had some BAD experiences in
the past. In fact i will be travelling to Africa by
May  this year as a member of the organising
comittee of a combined conferences on SUICIDE
PREVENTION STRATEGIES and CHILD LABOR taking place
in the U.S on the 12th---16th May,2006 at the Global

USA/Italy for a groundbreaking meeting of the international youth
movements and other related NGO's, where as many as 200 participants
will convene to learning new ways to empower themselves and how to
adhere to social norms. And also to meet others like yourself ;
learning, teaching, inspiring and being inspired. Exploring the
potential of a performance approach to unleash and nurture the human
capacity to create, collaborateand change the world.

What are the objectives of this meeting? The meeting will provide a
space where youth & women's rights advocates from diverse backgrounds
and working on different issues can engage with each other and with
like-minded donors, in order to:

Provide quality prevention of abuse of the youth and women.
Frankly discuss how NGO's and women's organizations and movements can
work together
Develop creative and innovative strategies to fight these social  ills
Advance child protection development through innovative projects
What will the program look like? Unlike other events of GYWO ,
instead, an international planning committee which is headed by Prof.
Steve Robbins will design a comprehensive program and select speakers.

The program will include:

Thought-provoking plenaries;
In-depth breakout sessions for strategy-development;
Simulation games to fast-track learning;
Capacity and skills-building sessions; and
Debates to stimulate discussion.
In addition to the main program, the meeting will also host book
launches, artistic and cultural activities and, as with all GYWO
events, plenty of space and opportunity for informal networking and
alliance-building.

All plenaries and selected breakout sessions will have interpretation
into English, Spanish and French.

Who can participate? What happens if more than 200 apply? Anyone who
is a member of  an NGO or progressive youth or women's organization or
community based organization can apply to participate. If more than
200 people apply (as we anticipate), a global selection committee will
select a representative 200 from among the applicants. This committee
will ensure that the participants at the meeting are truly
international and represent a diverse range of interests, issues, and
regions. Preference will be given to organizations working for youth &
women's rights from the Global South East Asia, Latin America and
Africa.

Fund"" to support the travel costs and hotel room bills for
participants who are unable to raise sufficient funds on their own.
All participants, however will be expected to fund raise for their
hotel bills in Italy, which will not be waived. This will help ensure
that only those who most need and want to be at the meeting will be
there. Applicants who need assistance can apply to the Access Fund at
the same time they apply to participate.

"YOUTH FORUM CONFERENCE 2006


Youth-Forum is a socialist youth organization. We are against capitalism and the war, racism, exploitation and alienation it creates. We are socialists - we want to abolish capitalism and replace it with a planned economy. But we do not believe that the capitalist elite will allow their wealth and privilege to be voted out of existence. We believe it will take force to take the power and property away from the few and redistribute into the hands of the many - that means a Youth-forum!

We want to organize young people across the world in this fight for a classless society built on the basis of equality and human freedom.

We want to leave the borders and divisions of nations behind and move forward to a truly global and united humanity, without bigotry, war and class division. 

We stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters and brothers in the Third World struggling to break free of the trillion dollar debt, the IMF, WTO and NATO. We fight alongside anyone we share a goal with. And we organize for youth-forum – the only solution to the world’s woes.

 A socialist society would be based on direct democracy, collective ownership and democratic planning of the economy for human need, not private greed. That’s what we stand for. If you want to help, you can join us today. 

YOUTH-FORUM is owned and controlled by its members. There are a wide range of different views, ideas and interests in YOUTH-FORUM – everyone can have a say and we make all our decisions democratically.

"Hi , 
       Thanks for your letter, first let me say compliment of the season to you. Sometimes, life certainly can feel that way and what better shelter from the storms and trials of daily life than friendship and to know that there is someone out there you can fall back on. Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out whom you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but when you lock eyes with them; you know that every moment they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless-the people you meet affect your life. So like I told you b4 that i will be attending a combined conference in Africa by AUGUST 2007. The conference is scheduled to hold in U.S first and follow by the one in Africa . I am one of the organizers of the forth coming youth combined conferences taking place in the U.S from 20th -24th AUGUST, 2007, in Guinea-Bissau , West African from 27th -31st AUGUST, 2007. We normally invite five delegates from each of the selected countries around the world. In our request to invite youths from the selected countries. But am inviting you now because I fail in love with you as if you are an organization, because that is what am going to tell them here in the office to enable them register you ok. So all I want you to do now is assist us in relating to one of the existing youths organization in your country. If not then form a group of five your self then contact the conference secretariat in the U.S through this fax +01-419-593-8078, or through this e-mail, yworeg2003@yahoo.com . when you write tell them i invited you give them my name, ( MISS GRACE MICHAEL) because i have given them your as the leader of your group then you will be the one to give the names people to them for them to know that you people are really group ok. But before they could be considered for participation in this most esteemed event, their organization will have to forward to the above address the following 
requirement.
1) The organization profile 
2) The Aims and Objectives of the organization 
3) Their achievements so far. With this information put into consideration by the organizing committee, they will be officially invited to participate in this .Our independent donor will take care of all their flight tickets and their accommodation throughout their stay in the U.S and the organizing committee will process the U.S visa for all participants requiring entry visas to the U.S. Participants will only take care of their accommodation during the other event in Guinea-Bissau. As one of the organizers I knew not of anybody from your country. Hence my writing to you is to gain assess to any youth organization in your country. If you are interested to participate and wants to represent your country, you should contact the secretary to the organizer for detail information on registration procedures and inform the organizer that I recommended you. You will need not to forward the above requirement for your group or organization; hence I will give your recommendation to the secretary. You are to contact the organizer as soon as possible as all participants visa request will be forwarded to the U.S Bureau of Immigrant Affairs for Authorization the same. Once this is done then let me know and I will fight the rest for you ok. Any group visa request not forwarded on that same day will miss the visa assistance. I am looking forward to seeing you.

"Hello Dearest, 
Thanx for your mail it's nice reading from you. 
I apologize for my delay in replying your mail. I have tough schedules lately. In my previous mail, I promised to tell you a little bit of my self. Time may not permit me to say much but friendship is a gift you give yourself... So taking the time to sit down and write a letter, is merely the opportunity to build a friendship that together we can share. Everyday unwrapping another layer, and discovering something new about one another.
Who knows what tomorrow brings..."" Hopefully it will bring me closer to you and the opportunity to get to know you on a much more intimate level. I'm looking forward to build a sincere and quality friendship with you. Now i undertake to write you a few lines. I have so much to say that I don't know what i should commence at first. I'm honest, respectful, non-judging, and open minded. What would i most like in someone that is interested in corresponding with me...? I'm looking for people who are genuine, sincere, honest, intelligent, witty, with a nice personality, a good sense of humour, I'm single and haven't marry once. I hate lies. I love some one who is trustworthy and does not smoke nor drink and an interest in getting to know someone new... 
I'm working with (WORLD YOUTH ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN WELFARE) here in my country United States. I'm Living alone at my own apartment given to me by my father. I'm the First child of my parents. My parent have three children, two girls and a boy by name Kelvin and Rachael as the last child. The name of my father is Danielle Norwoods and my mother's name is Jessica Danielle. My father is a Ex-Interim Executive Secretary and Treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor while my mother is one of the senior personnel of US Congress House Committee on Education and Labor here in California. Some times I'm always busy with the job activities. I've been opportune to have traveled to many countries around the globe in our course of executing our work and visiting some HIV/AIDS patient and refugee camps in other countries. I will be attending a combined International Conference on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Child Abuse/Labor in Africa this year 2007. The conference is scheduled to hold first in U.S and followed by the one in Africa (Senegal). As one of the Organizers of the fourth coming combined International Conferences on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Child Abuse/Labor taking place in the US and later in Africa (Senegal), we are inviting two to five (2-5)  delegates from each of the selected countries around the world. In our request to invite delegates from the selected countries, I went in search of e-mail on the website as a means of contacting interested delegates and Organizations in these countries. I picked your e-mail from a pen pal website. You will assist us in relating to one of the existing Organizations in your country to contact the Conference Secretariat in the US through this e-mail add: aidsconference2007@consultant.com or fax number: 
+1-208-575-6945
But before they could be considered for participation in this most esteemed event, their Organization will have to forward to the above address the following requirement: 
1) The Organization profile 
2) The Aims and Objectives of the Organization 
3) Their Achievements so far. 
With this information put into consideration by the Organizing Committee , they will be officially invited to participate in this International Conferences. Our independent donor will take care of their round trip Air flight tickets from their country of resident to U.S, U.S. to Africa (Senegal) and from Africa (Senegal) back to their various country of resident, their Accommodation and feeding throughout their stay in the U.S. and the Organizing Committee will process the U.S. visa for all participants requiring entry visa to the US with the assistant of our Immigration Advocates. Participants will only take care of their Accommodation during the other event in Africa (Senegal). As one of the Organizers i knew not of anybody from your country, hence my writing to you is to gain assess to any existing Organization in your country. If you are really interested to participate and want to represent your country, you should contact the Conference Secretariat in United States for full detail information on registration procedures and inform the Organizer that i Lilian Danielle recommended you. You  need not to forward the above requirement for your group or Organization registration, hence i will give your recommendation to the Secretary. You are to contact the Organizer as soon as possible as all participants visa request will be forwarded to the U.S. Bureau of Immigrant Affairs for Authorization the same day. Any group that did not forward their visa request on that same day with others will miss the visa assistance. You are to form a group of two to five (2-5) persons. Your group can be of different nationalities but all should be leaving in the same country for easy U.S. visa assistance. For your information two groups can be register from one country cos one of the group will be used to represent the country that couldn't be able to participate or present delegate.

"Dear Guest,
 
We acknowledge receipt of your mail.
 
First of all we want you to know that you are dealing with a 5star Hotel Management which was Officially chosen by the World Youth Organization for Human Welfare to host the second phase of one of the most historic event in the world. 
 
But i wish to inform you that our Hotel Policy for guest coming to this conference  states that, ""The official letter of the Hotel Booking Confirmation Receipt of any group that booked rooms with us, will be sent to them and a copy to the conference secretariat, as soon as we receive their payment"", As every other guest from various countries complied with our instructions before we issued out the official letter of the hotel booking confirmation receipt to them and a copy to the conference secretariat.
 
It is a game of risk for me to issue out the Official letter of the Hotel Booking Confirmation Receipt to you and a copy to the conference secretariat, while we have not received our payment, as I might likely loose my job if I go against the policy of our hotel management.
 
We shall send the official letter of the hotel booking confirmation receipt to you and a copy to the conference secretariat as soon as we receive your payment through any Western Union agent in the name of our accountant, OR THROUGH OUR ACCOUNT ANTHOUGH THE TIME LIMIT WILL NOT PERMIT US TO GET YOUR COMFIRMATION IN TIME IF YOU SEND YOUR BOOKING THROUGH OUR ACCOUNT. So Western Union is the Best and fastest option.
 
We wish you all a happy stay during your visit to our country.

Dear Applicant,
 
By recommendation, we accept you to participate in the forth-coming conferences, which will be held from  September 3rd -5th 2007, at the DISNEYLAND CONVENTION CENTER, ANAHEIM, C.A, U.S.A. and September 12th -14th 2007 at OLYMPIC STADIUM HALL, DAKAR-SENEGAL, West -Africa. We are accepting you to partake because you were recommended by one of our members. You may take the opportunity to participate in these International events.. The theme of the forth coming International Conferences is to equip participants with the strategies and policies to wage a global war against Racism & Child Abuse.
 
These events are being Organized and sponsored by the WORLD YOUTH ORGANIZATION FOR HUMAN WELFARE (WYOFHW) in collaboration with other benevolent organizations in the United States of America. The International Conference on Racism and Child Abuse shall be of  high significance for the international community because the issues it will address are evils which we must combat with all our power; because racism and Child Abuse--manifesting themselves through discrimination and all forms of intolerance -- are the wellsprings of many of the world's conflicts; because they are a key element of the vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion; and because these forces run directly contrary to the fundamental message of human rights which is that every member of the human family has equal and inalienable rights"". Despite continuing efforts by the international community, racial discrimination, ethic conflicts and widespread violence persist in various parts of the world. In recent years, the world has witnessed campaigns of ""ethnic cleansing"". Racial minorities, migrants, asylum eekers and indigenous peoples are persistent targets of intolerance. Millions of human beings continue to encounter discrimination solely due to the colour of their skin or other factors that indicate the race to which they belong. Effective and early action, as well as early warning measures, is required to prevent the growth of ethnic Hatred and potential violent conflicts.
 
The International Conferences against Racism & Child Abuse will be a unique opportunity to create a new world vision for the fight against racism and racial discrimination in the new millennium. In order to have a real impact, the Conference should not only promote greater awareness concerning the scourge of racism but also lead to decisive action at the international level in order to help those who suffer on a daily basis from racism and racial discrimination.
 
Concerted efforts and contributions by individuals, Governments, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and the various international bodies and specialized agencies will be necessary to accomplish the objectives of the Conferences, and to provide long-lasting solutions. It will also afford participants to meet the donor communities, strike Affiliations and partnerships and explore better ways of sourcing funds for their various activities among others, as universal electronic language translators will be available for all delegates that will like to make use of them.

The conference organizing committee inconjuction with the donor sponsoring committee has mapped out some beneficial awards to group participants that distinguished themselves in their areas of discipline. Panel of Judges has been appointed to oversee and to select participants of merit. Other gifts will be given to participants on merit. you are hereby advised to equip yourselves and exhibit your God given talents to the fullest. We welcome delegations, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations to the International Conference against Racism and Child Abuse.

This is the start of the formal phase of the Conference process, although a number of useful informal meetings have already taken place in different parts of the world. We expect that this event can and should give a powerful impetus to the work of laying the foundations for a successful combat against Racism and Child Abuse. To help us do all that we reasonably can to meet the demands of our registered delegates, our staffs are working day and night to make this event a success.
 
REGISTRATION OF PARTICIPANTS: Only a minimum of five (5) or a maximum of ten (10) people are expected to participate together as a group or organization to represent their Country in the forth-coming events. None of them should be less than eighteen years of age and must participate in both Conferences. It is not necessary that one must belong to an organization to be eligible to attend this event. Any groups of five (5) or ten (10) persons forming a group to represent a Country are eligible to participate in the forth-coming conferences. They should be in possession of their international passports to enable them participate in this conferences.

 

For registration to participate in this event, you may forward the names and passport numbers of your group members to us, as soon as possible, as all participants visa assistance request will be forwarded to the U.S Department of State for same day visa Authorization which shall be sent by fax to the consular section of the U.S. Embassy, in your country of residence. All registered participants are entitled to a round trip air tickets, meals and accommodation during their stay in the U.S. Delegates will only be responsible for their own hotel booking in Dakar-Senegal where the second phase of the conference will be held, due to the inability of our partner organizations to mobilize enough funds to sponsor the number of expected delegates to attend both conferences, and which will also serve as a prove that your group members will partake in the second phase of these events that will be held in Dakar-Senegal.

The strength of the working relations between the International Development Fund, the local Hosts Dallas and Oxford, the co-organizers, (the active participation of representatives of the international civil society) will contribute to make the 2007 CONGRESS a headlight event in the response to the scourge of under-development and poverty.

The sponsorships also covers participants feeding throughout their stay in the United Kingdom. Participants will only be responsible for their hotel reservation in Dakar-Senegal West Africa. The conference planning committee and some prominent personels in the UK have employed the service of the UK Bureau of Im migrant Affairs for the processing and authorisation of the UK Visas to participants. This will help to avoid the UK Visa restrictions and delays in the issuing of UK visas to participants at the British Embassy in participants Country.. Lesser and affordable Visa requirements have been set up for participants to meet up for the processing and authorisation of the UK entry visas by the UK Bureau of Immigrant Affairs.
 
With the fruitful assistance from the special Arms of charity, we shall provide the following for all registered participants and will be forwarded to the UK Bureau of Immigrant Affairs
 
1.Hotel confirmation for the conference in the UK, Participants will need to  provide their hotel confirmation for the second conference in Dakar-Senegal West-Africa

The ticket booklet will be issued to participants at the airline agent in their country or nearby country, only when the UK Bureau of Immigrant Affairs have sent us confirmation of participants UK Visas.

The hotel reservation must be paid for by the delegates who needs the Authorisation of the UK Visas to participate in this event. This is the instruction given by the United Kingdom's Bureau of Immigrant Affairs as a proof that delegates are really committed to participate in the second conference.The UK Bureau of I mmigrant Affairs have strongly warned that this is not an opened window for illegal migration to the United Kingdom. If you have plans to migrate illegally to the United Kingdom through this conference, be informed that , it won't be possible as participants must forward their hotel confirmation receipt in Dakar-Senegal before the issuance of their UK Visas.

"Hello Dear, 

Thanks for your letter. 
Sometimes life certainly can feel that way...and what better shelter from the storms and trials of daily life than friendship and to know that there is someone out there you can fall back on. Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there...to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become.You never know who these people may be but when you look eyes with them, you know that every moment they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck, illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless, the people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience can create who you are and the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. So if you're seriously looking for a friend to get to know, you have finally found me. I'm glad to meet you too. I'm Living alone at my own apartment given to me by our Organization. I'm the First child of my parents. My parent have two children and the two of us are girls, Monica as the last child. The name of my father is Michael Richardson and my mother's name is Latoya Michael.My father is a Ex-FBI Agent to the United States while my mother is one of the senior personnel of US Congress House Committee on Education and Labor here in California. I'm single and haven't marry once.I hate lies. I love some one who is trustworthy and does not smoke nor drink. Some times I'm always busy with the job activities. I've been opportune to have traveled to many countries around the globe in our course of executing our work and visiting some HIV/AIDS patient and refugee camps in other countries. I will be attending a combined International Conference on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Child Abuse/Labor in Africa this year 2008.The conference is scheduled to hold first in U.S and followed by the one in West Africa (Senegal).As one of the Organizers of the fourth coming combined International Conferences on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Child Abuse/Labor taking place in the US and latter in Africa (Senegal),West Africa, we are inviting two to five (2-5) delegates from each of the selected countries around the world.

Hello Dear,
Thanks for your letter.
Sometimes life certainly can feel that way...and what better shelter from the storms and trials of daily life than friendship and to know that there is someone out there you can fall back on. Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there...to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become.You never know who these people may be but when you look eyes with them, you know that every moment they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck, illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless, the people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience can create who you are and the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. So if you're seriously looking for a friend to get to know, you have finally found me. I'm glad to meet you too. I'm Living alone at my own apartment given to me by our Organization. I'm the First child of my parents. My parent have two children and the two of us are girls, Monica as the last child. The name of my father is Michael Richardson and my mother's name is Latoya Michael.My father is a Ex-FBI Agent to the United States while my mother is one of the senior personnel of US Congress House Committee on Education and Labor here in California. I'm single and haven't marry once.I hate lies. I love some one who is trustworthy and does not smoke nor drink. Some times I'm always busy with the job activities. I've been opportune to have traveled to many countries around the globe in our course of executing our work and visiting some HIV/AIDS patient and refugee camps in other countries. I will be attending a combined International Conference on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Child Abuse/Labor in Africa this year 2008.The conference is scheduled to hold first in U.S and followed by the one in West Africa (Senegal).As one of the Organizers of the fourth coming combined International Conferences on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Child Abuse/Labor taking place in the US and latter in Africa (Senegal),West Africa, we are inviting two to five (2-5) delegates from each of the selected countries around the world.

The world wide concern about global warming and it's impact on the fate of the planet has risen to unprecedented levels in the last few years. 
This explosion of information on Global Warming and Climate Change has made all of us much more aware of what is happening. But, the sheer magnitude of it can also be overwhelming. We often ask ourselves, in spite of all the media, are we really certain about what we need to know and is there anything we as average citizens can do about it? 
 
Join us on May 9th-13th,2008, as we learn the answers to those 
two important questions, What Do We Know? What Can We Do? 
1) How does Global Warming and Climate Change impact our environment and our community 
2) What common sense approaches do we need to adopt to effect real 
change 
3) What are simple and low cost ways that will help us save energy 
4) What will it take to build a green community 
 
The conference would be held at: 
Hyde Park Hotel 
15 Sussex Place 
Hyde Park London W2 2SX 
United Kingdom 
Date: 9th-13th May, 2008
 
GWCC 08 has set up an Access Fund to support the travel costs and all-round air fare cost for participants who are unable to raise sufficient funds on their own.

"Hi , 
       Thanks for your letter, first let me say compliment of the season to you. Sometimes, life certainly can feel that way and what better shelter from the storms and trials of daily life than friendship and to know that there is someone out there you can fall back on. Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out whom you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but when you lock eyes with them; you know that every moment they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless-the people you meet affect your life. So like I told you b4 that i will be attending a combined conference in Africa by DECEMBER 2008. The conference is scheduled to hold in U.S first and follow by the one in Africa .

But before they could be considered for participation in this most esteemed event, their organization will have to forward to the above address the following

With this information put into consideration by the organizing committee, they will be officially invited to participate in this .Our independent donor will take care of all their flight tickets and their accommodation throughout their stay in the U.S and the organizing committee will process the U.S visa for all participants requiring entry visas to the U.S. Participants will only take care of their accommodation during the other event in Guinea-Bissau.

Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there...to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but when you lock eyes with them; you know that every moment they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless-the people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience can create who you are, and the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. So if you're seriously looking for a friend to get to know, You have found me. I am glad to meet you too. Like as I have already informed you in my previous letter about my job. I am Living alone at my own apartment given to me by my father. I am the First child of my parents. My parent have three children, one girl and a Two boys by name Mark and Junior I’m the first as i have said .The name of my father's is  Anderson  Sherak 

 and my mother's name is Margret Sherak 

 father is a business to man while my mother is an house wife. I am single and haven’t married once. My hobbies are reading, watching movies, listening to soft music’s, long driving, swimming and traveling hate delay, that is sluggishness and procrastinating, I hate lies. I love some one who is trustworthy and does not smoke nor drink. I love nature and sometimes I wish I owned a house in the country not far from a city. You wake up to fresh mountain air, gaze the green scenery ,see green verges growing in your little garden and so much more. Kind of boring right? No, imagine I am with my sweetheart in those quite surroundings. I will be attending a combined conference in Guinea Bissau .   Child Welfare and Development Strategies 

 It is organized to assist in the present crisis and wars, which have cause the high increase of Refugees and Displaced peoples. This program required interested applicants to make a group of five or ten members to participate and benefit from this, your org participation will go a long way to improve the standard of living in your area, The Conference program is due to commence from 1st  to 5th  December  2008 and The second conference on WAR AGAINST CHILD ABUSE will take place at the 168 Augustineho Gomes Avenue Bissau Guinea Bissau the second Conference which is scheduled to take place in Guinea Bissau between Bissau 23rd  -27th  of December 2008  it’s titled Child Welfare and Development Strategies (CWDS).

CONFERENCE THEME:

THE ECONOMICS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE Global ECONOMIC CRISIS ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

""While recently we have heard much about how problems on Wall Street are affecting Innocent people on Main Street, we need to think more about those people around the world with no streets. Wall Street, Main Street, no street – the solutions devised must be for all. Almost two years after the Lehman Brothers collapsed, we are still struggling to come out of this meltdown as unemployment continues to rise. Are we any safer than we were a couple of year ago? How well paved is the road to recovery? Have we learnt our lessons from the global meltdown?"" Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, UN General Secretary.

The recent United Nations Climate Change Conference has been widely perceived as a failure, while the consequences of global warming continue to mount. Weather patterns are changing radically, natural disasters grow more frequent and more devastating, sea levels rise, cultural and biological diversity becomes more endangered, and economic prosperity decreases. Despite two years of advance work, the meeting failed to convert a rare gathering of world leaders into an ambitious, legally binding action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

More than 7,000 people responded to our June 2010 economic survey, which measured the impact of these difficult economic times on the nonprofit sector. Among respondents, nearly half were CEOs, executive directors, or presidents—our leaders in the nonprofit industry. The results are compelling:

- Some 40 percent of participants reported that contributions to their organizations dropped between January 1 and May 31, 2010, compared to the same period a year earlier.

- Eight percent indicated that their organizations were in imminent danger of closing.

- Sixty-three percent reported a total increase in demand for their organization's services between January 1, 2010 and May 31, 2010, compared to the same period a year prior.

The Global Strategies for Sustainable Development-GSSDEV is holding the first largest and most diverse international gathering, dedicated to The Economic Crisis in its implications on sustainable development with a theme: The Economics Of Climate Change : Impact and implications of the global economic crisis on sustainable development

You are cordially invited to contribute to the success of this event with your effective participation.

The international community is now challenged by the severe impact on development of multiple, interrelated global crises and challenges, such as increased food insecurity, volatile energy and commodity prices, climate change, and a global economic crisis. The Global Strategies for Sustainable Development offers by far the best analysis of how the financial crisis will affect humanitarian and development funding and how to develop a counter-cyclical strategy building. The conference programme is dedicated to the current situation and offers an open international forum for the discussion of this topic. The aim is to establish new design perspectives and actions through dialogue with representatives from civil society, politics, economics, and science, individuals, etc.

The First 2011 GSSDEV Annual Conference and Steering Meeting will take place from:

Conference dates and locations:

• 6th – 11th 2011 June in New York, USA

• 13 – 17th June 2011 in Accra-Ghana





Participants are highly encouraged to attend the entire conference. This will give the best opportunity to exchange of ideas and to further develop the conference programme while enhancing the collaboration between the different participating institutions.

Venue: The conferences will take place in two selected different host countries: one in one in High Income Country (United States of America) and the second in a Middle and Low Income country (Ghana). The conference in New York – USA will take place at NYC Seminar and Conference Center. The conference in Accra-Ghana will take place at Accra International Conference Center (AICC). There are excellent hotels in nearby distances from these venues.

GSSDEV Background: The Global Strategies for Sustainable Development - GSSDEV is a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of world economy and Sustainable Development. The Centre provides timely analysis, and concrete solutions to a wide range of international economic and financial problems. The pursuit of sustainable development requires adequate attention and interactions among the environment, society and the economy. As such, GSSDEV explores how the environment is valued; how public policy instruments can be designed better; and how abject poverty can be addressed sustainably. Background documents and information are available on the GSSDEV website.

Conference Methodology: The conference is organized as an open discussion forum and provides scope for participants to explore the ins and outs of the economic crisis and it implications on sustainable development. Presentations by acclaimed experts from different fields of knowledge during the first half of the conference will form the starting point of the subsequent discussions. In the second half of the conference, participants will be divided into groups to work out the core issues from the focus points of the conference. The results and recommendations from the groups will be presented in plenum, discussed and finally made available to the participants;

The Conference will also provide various opportunities to engage participants in sharing experiences and articulating perspectives on how to enhance their activities in the financing of their various projects, especially the NGOs/CBOs including round table panel discussions and break-out sessions, interactive dialogue, workshops, caucuses and other activities.

Call for papers:

The conference will welcome submissions from non-profits, NGOs, CBOs, CSOs, scholars, financial experts, policy makers, and other practitioners. Participants will be able to enjoy shows, attractions, activities, and tours available in host cities.

The following topics can be covered in your submission and presentation:

# The Economic Crisis and the Climate Change

# Where does the world’s climate now stand with respect to global warming? Are we already at or beyond the “tipping point” beyond which there is no return?

# What can economists tell us about the costs and benefits of mitigation policies? What measures are most efficient from an economic perspective and in terms of carbon reduction?

# The Impact of the Financial and Economic Crisis on MDG's

# The Impact of the Financial and Economic Crisis on Developing Countries

# How can we best address the employment effects of these diverse climate proposals given the fragile states of the world economies?

# Proposals include cap and trade, carbon tax, development of renewable energy, new technologies, energy efficiency and changing the patterns of consumption.

# How does international policy ensure justice and fairness in global warming policy measures? To what extent do the proposed measures imply a just distribution of burdens and benefits for developing countries?

# If mitigation policies are too little and/or too late, what are realistic adaptation strategies that address the needs of poor countries and poor areas of rich countries burdened more than others?

# Any other related topic

Instructions for submission of papers:


# Please note that your submission is not limited to the above-mentioned topics and cross-disciplinary works are highly encouraged.

# The deadline for submitting papers is January 30, 2011 and early submissions are welcomed.

CONFERENCE THEME:

THE ECONOMICS OF CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE Global ECONOMIC CRISIS ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

""While recently we have heard much about how problems on Wall Street are affecting Innocent people on Main Street, we need to think more about those people around the world with no streets. Wall Street, Main Street, no street – the solutions devised must be for all. Almost two years after the Lehman Brothers collapsed, we are still struggling to come out of this meltdown as unemployment continues to rise. Are we any safer than we were a couple of year ago? How well paved is the road to recovery? Have we learnt our lessons from the global meltdown?"" Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, UN General Secretary.

The recent United Nations Climate Change Conference has been widely perceived as a failure, while the consequences of global warming continue to mount. Weather patterns are changing radically, natural disasters grow more frequent and more devastating, sea levels rise, cultural and biological diversity becomes more endangered, and economic prosperity decreases. Despite two years of advance work, the meeting failed to convert a rare gathering of world leaders into an ambitious, legally binding action plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

More than 7,000 people responded to our June 2010 economic survey, which measured the impact of these difficult economic times on the nonprofit sector. Among respondents, nearly half were CEOs, executive directors, or presidents—our leaders in the nonprofit industry. The results are compelling:

- Some 40 percent of participants reported that contributions to their organizations dropped between January 1 and May 31, 2010, compared to the same period a year earlier.

- Eight percent indicated that their organizations were in imminent danger of closing.

- Sixty-three percent reported a total increase in demand for their organization's services between January 1, 2010 and May 31, 2010, compared to the same period a year prior.

The Global Strategies for Sustainable Development-GSSDEV is holding the first largest and most diverse international gathering, dedicated to The Economic Crisis in its implications on sustainable development with a theme: The Economics Of Climate Change : Impact and implications of the global economic crisis on sustainable development

You are cordially invited to contribute to the success of this event with your effective participation.

The international community is now challenged by the severe impact on development of multiple, interrelated global crises and challenges, such as increased food insecurity, volatile energy and commodity prices, climate change, and a global economic crisis. The Global Strategies for Sustainable Development offers by far the best analysis of how the financial crisis will affect humanitarian and development funding and how to develop a counter-cyclical strategy building. The conference programme is dedicated to the current situation and offers an open international forum for the discussion of this topic. The aim is to establish new design perspectives and actions through dialogue with representatives from civil society, politics, economics, and science, individuals, etc.

The First 2011 GSSDEV Annual Conference and Steering Meeting will take place from:

Conference dates and locations:

• 6th – 11th 2011 June in New York, USA

• 13 – 17th June 2011 in Accra-Ghana





Participants are highly encouraged to attend the entire conference. This will give the best opportunity to exchange of ideas and to further develop the conference programme while enhancing the collaboration between the different participating institutions.

Venue: The conferences will take place in two selected different host countries: one in one in High Income Country (United States of America) and the second in a Middle and Low Income country (Ghana). The conference in New York – USA will take place at NYC Seminar and Conference Center. The conference in Accra-Ghana will take place at Accra International Conference Center (AICC). There are excellent hotels in nearby distances from these venues.

GSSDEV Background: The Global Strategies for Sustainable Development - GSSDEV is a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of world economy and Sustainable Development. The Centre provides timely analysis, and concrete solutions to a wide range of international economic and financial problems. The pursuit of sustainable development requires adequate attention and interactions among the environment, society and the economy. As such, GSSDEV explores how the environment is valued; how public policy instruments can be designed better; and how abject poverty can be addressed sustainably. Background documents and information are available on the GSSDEV website.

Conference Methodology: The conference is organized as an open discussion forum and provides scope for participants to explore the ins and outs of the economic crisis and it implications on sustainable development. Presentations by acclaimed experts from different fields of knowledge during the first half of the conference will form the starting point of the subsequent discussions. In the second half of the conference, participants will be divided into groups to work out the core issues from the focus points of the conference. The results and recommendations from the groups will be presented in plenum, discussed and finally made available to the participants;

The Conference will also provide various opportunities to engage participants in sharing experiences and articulating perspectives on how to enhance their activities in the financing of their various projects, especially the NGOs/CBOs including round table panel discussions and break-out sessions, interactive dialogue, workshops, caucuses and other activities.

Call for papers:

The conference will welcome submissions from non-profits, NGOs, CBOs, CSOs, scholars, financial experts, policy makers, and other practitioners. Participants will be able to enjoy shows, attractions, activities, and tours available in host cities.

The following topics can be covered in your submission and presentation:

# The Economic Crisis and the Climate Change

# Where does the world’s climate now stand with respect to global warming? Are we already at or beyond the “tipping point” beyond which there is no return?

# What can economists tell us about the costs and benefits of mitigation policies? What measures are most efficient from an economic perspective and in terms of carbon reduction?

# The Impact of the Financial and Economic Crisis on MDG's

# The Impact of the Financial and Economic Crisis on Developing Countries

# How can we best address the employment effects of these diverse climate proposals given the fragile states of the world economies?

# Proposals include cap and trade, carbon tax, development of renewable energy, new technologies, energy efficiency and changing the patterns of consumption.

# How does international policy ensure justice and fairness in global warming policy measures? To what extent do the proposed measures imply a just distribution of burdens and benefits for developing countries?

# If mitigation policies are too little and/or too late, what are realistic adaptation strategies that address the needs of poor countries and poor areas of rich countries burdened more than others?

# Any other related topic

Instructions for submission of papers:


# Please note that your submission is not limited to the above-mentioned topics and cross-disciplinary works are highly encouraged.

# The deadline for submitting papers is January 30, 2011 and early submissions are welcomed.

"Greetings,

The worldwide concern about Domestic Violence; its impact on the fate of growing population of the world, has risen to unprecedented levels in the last few years.  This explosion of information on Domestic Violence has made all of us much more aware of what is happening. But, the sheer magnitude of it can also be overwhelming. We often ask ourselves, in spite of all the media; are we really certain about what we need to know and are there anything we as average citizens can do about it?

 Join our organization, International Forum for Women Affairs for our combine conference with Theme, VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN, as we learn the answers to those two important questions concerning Violence against women and children,

What Do We Know?
What Can We Do?

We aspire to:
1) Tackle this scourge of Violence against women and children.
2) Establish relationship between Groups, NGO's and Individuals that

or 4 (roughly equivalent to GS-11 or GS-12 in the U.S. 
Federal Competitive Civil Service). The Foreign Service 
Schedule comprises nine classes, FS-9 through FS-1, 
(with FS-1being the highest), and on to the Senior 
Foreign Service (comparable to the Senior Executive 
Service).New Entrants at both levels are evaluated 
yearly by their supervisor. These evaluations are then 
reviewed by Selection Boards which rank all Foreign 
Service Officers by class and functional group for 
promotion based upon relative performance standing.
MOBILITY
All Foreign Service Officers must be available for 
worldwide assignment and are expected to spend a 
substantial portion of their careers in developing 
countries. Specific assignments are identified according 
to the needs of the Agency. They normally serve two 
tours of two years each at one post, interrupted by Rest 
and Recuperation (R&R) and Home Leave (HL). Foreign
Service Officers are required to serve one or more 
rotation tours (usually three years) in Washington, D.C. 
during the course of their careers. Although they are 
assigned, and are required to serve wherever their 
talents are most needed, every possible consideration is 
given to their personal preferences and career 
development needs. An applicant whose spouse may also be 
employed as a Foreign Service Officer by USAID or one of 
the Foreign Affairs agencies, should be aware that there
may be instances during their careers when the Agency 
will not be able to assign both employees to the same 
post. Under such circumstances, the officer may elect to 
accept tours in separate posts or one spouse may choose 
to accompany the other and request leave without pay 
(LWOP) for the length of the tour.
SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES
Starting salaries for New Entrants are based upon the FS 
grade level at which the applicant is appointed. Foreign 
Service pay scales are set by Congress and are reviewed 
annually for cost-of-living adjustments. New Entrants 
who do not reside in the United states are reimbursed 
for their own and their dependents' assignment travel to 
Washington, D.C. and shipment for household effects.At 
overseas posts, New Entrants receive non-taxable 
government housing, as well as a non-taxable 
cost-of-living allowance where the cost of living is 
higher than in Washington, D.C. They may also receive a 
""school-away-from-post"" allowance for the education of 
their dependent children. A taxable differential of 
5-20% of basic salary may be paid for service at 
designated overseas posts.Other benefits include paid 
annual leave, home leave,and sick leave; contributory 
government life and group health insurance coverage 
selected by the New Entrant; medical care and 
hospitalization overseas; transportation to and from 
post; shipment of authorized weights of household goods, 
and, where permitted, shipment of a motor vehicle.
These programs are focused in the following sectors: 
microbusiness/microcredit, agriculture, water & 
sanitation, health and nutrition, community  
mobilization, conflict resolution and civil society 
development. USAAID works in partnership with other
international NGOs, local NGOs, community based 
organizations (CBOs), local government and line 
ministries. Funding originates from  USDA, European 
Commission, Community Fund, Taiwan, British Foreign 
Office, SIDA, UNICEF  and China.
 
RETIREMENT AND ANNUITIES
New Entrants employed with USAID are under the Foreign 
Service Pension System (FSPS). Under the FSPS, they may 
retire voluntarily after 20 years of service. Such 
service includes all creditable government and military 
service. Retirement is mandatory at age 65.
New Entrants enrolled in the FSPS contribute to both the 
Foreign Service Retirement System and Social Security. 
This is a three-tiered system with employees being 
allowed to contribute to (1) a thrift savings plan, (2) 
a defined annuity plan, and (3) social security. The 
annuity is based upon 1.7% times the first 20 years in 
the foreign service times the ""high three average"" base 
salary. The additional years after 20 are multiplied by 
1.0% times the high three base salary. The maximum 
period of creditable service is 35 years.

"Dear FIRSTNAME LASTNAME
           
                     We believe that by now the Tecnip Group must have contacted you. Please as the Co-ordinator for expertriate missions, it is my office mandate to see to your safe arrival to Nigeria, after approval by the Technip Group 
I humbly will have to tell you the due process before by the grace of God you will join the Tecnip group Family. 
1. Being that the Tecnip Group needs your immediate services your Visa will have to be arranged. This means that you will not have to go and start filling for Visa. Tecnip group will have to arrange for a Visa for you and all you will have to do will be to go to the High Comission there, meet a correspondant, submit your passport and pick it up the same day with your visa. But Working in acordance with the Tecnip Groups Policy, the Tecnip group and the employee will have to do this in corcondance. This is because in past times they have ended up sponsoring Visa approvals and at the end of the day the so called expertriate will end up not showing up. 
To this effect, It will cost $1500to process a Visa for you. This means you will have to pay a visa prcessing fee of a $1500 and the Tecnip Group will take care of the remaining $1000. 
2. The $ 1500 will be given back tou you on arival after signing the final memorandum of understanding between you and Tecnip Group. 
3. The Tecnip Group will take care of Your Flight Expenses. But in case of any un-forseen Circumstances, like having to go back Imediately after Arival, The Tecnip Group will not be responsible for your flight expences back. 
4. Because The Tecnip Group recruited three expertriates The Tecnip Group will want to start the processing of the Visa's by April 5th 2006. My office may Require the Payment of the $1500
before then this is to enable us for speedy Processing, starting from the Imigrations Office here. 
Regards 
James C. 
Co-rdinator Expertriate mission 
Tecnip Group. 
**** see previous mails for full Address**** 
NB.. It will take 2 weeks + but not more than 3 weeks for the process to be completed and picking up of visa

(as an attachment to an e-mail), my resume. In the

Dear Firstname,
 
There is a problem with our transfer.

Today I received the attached letter from our bank.
 
Our bank inform us that transfer was blocked by our Central Bank (BECAO).
I learnt that your product need to be registered in Benin before payment can be allowed out of the country, and I was told that there are some commercial lawyers who handle such registration process. I will consult some law chambers tomorrow to know what it takes to register your product in this country. I am very sorry for any inconveniences.

Subject: Re: Quality inspection and control

Dear Firstname,
 
Good evening !
 
It has been a busy week for me.
I understand that your product must have Quality Inspection and Certification issued by the agency. 
The things required are:
1. Physical product samples.
2. Free sale certificate issued by the appropriate authority in the country of the product origin.
3. Import declaration approval
4. Proforma Invoice
5. Processing fees
 
Regarding payment, please I would like you to urgently assist me to settle this pending matter.
As you can see, there is one document in the above list called import declaration approval, please issue me another Proforma Invoice that will not be above Euro 10,000. I will use this invoice to process import declaration approval because 10% tax is required upon any invoice amount, and this is my responsibility. And also the same invoice will be used to process quality inspection certification in your favour.
 
Again you can see that, there is no way one can deduct money from the amount that already in the bank and  blocked except to transfer to your account upon settlement of this matter. 
 
Beside, I don't even want the customers that have deposited their money to know that your product has not been registered and for this reason transfer was blocked. If they hear, they will not allow the transfer to go ahead. So please you can send the money to the attorney by Western Union Money Transfer and he will take the money to do the necessary things immediately. 
 
The attorney will official file an application for your product to under go quality inspection test on Monday, and the agency might contact you directly for other information. The attorney inform me that to do the necessary processing will cost you Euro3500.
 
Here is the contact detail of the attorney:

Hello,
Thanks for replying back to my online job posting, requiring your
tutorial I would like to make a tutoring arrangement between you and
my 10 years old Daughter for the month of June-July 2009, I would like
you to tutor her within a period of 1 month, on a schedule basis of 1
hr Daily, 3 times weekly, totaling 12 times in a month. I am willing
to pay $50/hr. I would like to use these medium to inform you that my
Daughter don't live in the US, she would be flying from Dubai to the
US, I want you to teach her during her 8 month stay in the US, if
there is need to extend your services, an amendment would be made to
your salary. she would be dropped off/picked up by his nanny during
the hours of teaching at any location you want the Tutoring to take
place in your area.You would be receiving a check drawn from a Bank in
the US, from my business associates in the US, since i am from Dubai
and right now am in Cuba for a business trip the  payments wont be
honored in any bank there in Dubai or here in Cuba , These check would
be made out for the cost of the tutorial services you are rendering,
and also for the living expense, nanny fees of my Daughter .
Regarding this- I hope i can trust you with these payments, as the
payment would be made out in excess, so all you have to do is Deposit
and cash the payment  at your bank, deduct your tutorial service fee,
which should be $50 per hour X 12 Times a Month = $600 i would include
an additional $100 for run around fee and any additional text book you
might be needing- so $700 is what you deduct from the check you
receive , whatever the remaining balance is after deduction of the
$700 go ahead and deduct Money Gram or Western union  transfer sending
charges for sending out the remainder to the Nanny who would be
contacting you with further arrangements and instructions regarding
pickup/drop off of my Daughter to the library where you would always
teach her. So i hope i can trust you that you will teach my Daughter
good academics and some moral respects so that they can be good to
their self in the future, i hope i can count on you for the tutorial
and the money to be sent to the Nanny. I look forward to read a
detailed message from you containing the following information, if you
are OK with my arrangements.
Full Name.
Mailing Address including Zip Codes ( No PO Box ).
Cell No ( If Available ).
Home No.
Best Time to Call.

Kindy send your information to me @  scottmcintire62@yahoo.com

at the same time, she understand English, can write and read fluently

How are you doing,I am Mr.Frank Vrabel  i beleive that education is the bedrock of wisdom i saw your description and i am very interested in having my child attend your classes, my son is 16 years old , he will be coming for an holiday season in your area, he knows some things about your lessons,so i want him to be more grounded in it very well and as a juvenile i dont want him to be less busy so that he wont think of the unthinkables if you understand.
    He will be attending your classes 1hour a day (10am to 11am)if this is not convenient for you ,you can choose a time that is more convenient for you,so what you will do is calculate the cost for a month and send me the total cost, so that we can arrange and come to final conclusion

Hello,
Thanks for replying back to my online job posting, requiring your
tutorial I would like to make a tutoring arrangement between you and
my 10 years old Daughter for the month of June-July 2009, I would like
you to tutor her within a period of 1 month, on a schedule basis of 1
hr Daily, 3 times weekly, totaling 12 times in a month. I am willing
to pay $50/hr. I would like to use these medium to inform you that my
Daughter don't live in the US, she would be flying from Dubai to the
US, I want you to teach her during her 8 month stay in the US, if
there is need to extend your services, an amendment would be made to
your salary. she would be dropped off/picked up by his nanny during
the hours of teaching at any location you want the Tutoring to take
place in your area.You would be receiving a check drawn from a Bank in
the US, from my business associates in the US, since i am from Dubai
and right now am in Cuba for a business trip the  payments wont be
honored in any bank there in Dubai or here in Cuba , These check would
be made out for the cost of the tutorial services you are rendering,
and also for the living expense, nanny fees of my Daughter .
Regarding this- I hope i can trust you with these payments, as the
payment would be made out in excess, so all you have to do is Deposit
and cash the payment  at your bank, deduct your tutorial service fee,
which should be $50 per hour X 12 Times a Month = $600 i would include
an additional $100 for run around fee and any additional text book you
might be needing- so $700 is what you deduct from the check you
receive , whatever the remaining balance is after deduction of the
$700 go ahead and deduct Money Gram or Western union  transfer sending
charges for sending out the remainder to the Nanny who would be
contacting you with further arrangements and instructions regarding
pickup/drop off of my Daughter to the library where you would always
teach her. So i hope i can trust you that you will teach my Daughter
good academics and some moral respects so that they can be good to
their self in the future, i hope i can count on you for the tutorial
and the money to be sent to the Nanny. I look forward to read a
detailed message from you containing the following information, if you
are OK with my arrangements.
Full Name.
Mailing Address including Zip Codes ( No PO Box ).
Cell No ( If Available ).

Hello *****,
I really hope you are still interested to buy this bike !
Bike is in perfect shape. NO ACCIDENTS. NO DENTS. NO SCRATCHES.NO CRACKS. 
NO DAMAGE. Kept inside. It is in showroom
condition. All service - on time. BIKE IS ROAD READY. I also have all the 
original equipment.
Used only on limited weekend basis in the summer. The maintenance schedule 
has been followed to the letter and all service has been performed by 
dealer.All maintenance is documented. The bike has a clear title.
I will provide you all the papers you need for the bike together with the 
CLEAR title!!! This will be transferable to your name.
I want to let you know that i just married and i decided to follow my wife 
in Rotterdam, Netherlands.I took the bike with me thinking to register 
here,but when i saw how big registration taxes are here,i decided that is 
better to sell it within USA space,is even cheaper for me to deliver it in 
USA or Canada than to register here.
I want to make the transaction throught www.alliancedelivers.com . This is 
a 3-th part service. They will protect your money and my bike.
They will keep your money in their custody till you will receive and 
inspect the bike. I'm sure we can proceed this way.You will have 5 days to 
inspect the bike that is like I described to you, after that you will 
contact the escrow company to release the money.
You will be able to properly check the bike and verify the papers so 
everything matches my description!
This is an insurance for you that I am correct! If there is something that 
is not as described, then you just ship the bike back my charges and the 
escrow service will fully refund you! The price for the bike is 4750 CAD 
including all the shipping taxes, insurance and handling to your home 
address.

If you have more questions please call me here: 0031 622 049 716
Thank you for your prompt response and I am looking forward to hearing from 
you!!

Now maybe this idea of mine will be helpfull to make the transaction as soon as posible,
I shall use for payment Western Union,but you make the transfer to UK to any name and address
that you want(it can be your wife's name or your father's).You just give me the money transfer control number so 
i can check that the funds are available,and that they are in the system. 
Once i have the confirmation that the funds are available,i give the shipping company the confirmation to shipp the bike to you
After you receive the bike you just go to an Western Union agency and change the name and address of the receiver with my name(that will not cost anything)
Is this way i have the warranty that the funds are available,and you have the warranty that i can not touch the money untill you receive and inspect the bike.
 
I wait your answer

"Hello VictimName,
       I am in receipt of your email. I will be able to offer you the loan of $10.000.00 I have stated the terms of the loan below for you to see and tell me if you are in agreement with the loan terms or not. 
 
                                  *Loan Amount:$10.000.00USD
                                  *Loan Rate :5%
                                  *Duration: 5years(60months)

                                           CONDITION
     There are two option which you are required to choose from which is the collaterals and non collateral loans 
 
1. Collaterals Process:  I usually require an equity based property as collateral for my loan aquisition. You need to send me a collateral for this loan so that i may have the trust that as soon as i give you this loan, you will pay back at the need of the terms. I do not accept any other property type or kind due to the fact that some of our customers have missed used this oppotunity. They some times claim to have properties and send us copies of ownership, and when they are not able to pay back the loan and i want to claim these properties i then find out that the properties belong to their family.The family will then say they did not attest to the transaction at first so please you have to make sure that the collaterals you are dropping belongs to you and notyour family.
 
   Non Collaterals Process:  This process required deposited of payment. For the loan of $10,000.00 you are entitled to send a payment of $350 so that  if you are unable to pay back the loan,your collaral will be claim and you will be placed on the media house by the bank as most wanted person which will destroy your family names plus yours. If you pay back the loan,your payment will be returned back to you. One thing about this alternative option is that it is a Non-collateral/security obtained from banks here which is popularly known as bank securities. When you obtain this non-collateral/security, it actually yield value which will eventually be equivalent to the loan you are obtaining during the stipulated duration of the loan. When you are unable to pay back the issuing Bank take the non-collateral which has yielded value as substitute for the loan. 
 
    I will issue out your loan to the transfering bank immediately the collateral is provided or the non collateral for the loan is acquired from the bank. Because of the risk and expenses when collarals are presented, So this is why  i personally will always advice that our customers should simply go for the non collateral alternative when they do not have an equity based property to present as colleral.But if you still insist that you present an quity based property then that will be ok with us.
 
2. Transfer Of Your Loan: 
  Bank to Bank Transfer : The transfer of the loan must be a bank to bank transfer, except otherwise stated by the borrower which means, you will have to provide the means which you want your loan transfer to you.
 
3. Loan agreement document:The Loan agreement document need to be signed to trust some guarntee of you to me that i can trust you. Remember that is a large some of  amount which is needed by you.
 
4. Loan refund:The loan must refunded back to the lender at the end of the tenure the loan seeker is seeking the loan for without any delay.for this reason, for this reason,we are giving a maximum duration of five years to the loan seeker so that he /she will be able to repay the loan within that period. 
 
   And  note that you willhave to send me a copy of your identity card so that i may know who i am dealing with.
  
    Considering the above conditions if they are acceptable to you,you have to give me a fast response so that i can assign my lawyer to send you the loan agreement document , so that i can start processing your loan.if you have a friend phone unmber please send it to us so that we can rich you better.

"Dear Sir,

I am in receipt of your mail and proceeded this morning to the United Nations Regional Head office in Houston - Texas to commence action on the process that will lead to our getting the Diplomatic Non Inspection sticker that will be necessary for the immediate admittance of the consignment into the United States of America and the delivery of same to you. 

Anyway, i have been able to make preliminary inquiries into what it will take to secure the Diplomatic Non Inspection sticker aside the official requirement of requesting the details about the consignment, requesting for my details as well and having my finger-print and photograph taken.This is in terms of the official charges that is been levied on consignment under the category of ours.

In view of the above, we will be required to pay Three thousand, Five Hundred and Eighty US Dollars only (US$3,500.00).The reason why we have to pay is because of the fact of what i highlighted above and because of the fact that neither you nor the shipper are Diplomats.

There is nothing i can do on my part because i never anticipated that i will be staying this long in the United States; which have forced me to spend so much on hotel and other unexpected expenses.

I will like for arrangement to be made towards sending the above sum immediately through Moneygram with the information that is stated below:

Jacqueline Wy
UN Plaza
4206 Post Oak Blvd
Houston-Texas
Amount: $1,750

And

Ramos Vasquez
UN Plaza
4206 Post Oak Blvd
Houston-Texas
Amount: $1,750

The reasons being that any further delay will start raising suspicions as to why the consignment has not been cleared since i came in and would start accumulating demurrage and storage fee since it has been taken to the US customs bonded warehouse.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soonest.

merchant for his last oil deal with my boss Mikhail
Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have been deposited with
ACCESS TRESURY SERVICES PLC UK ,where the final crediting is
expected to be carried out. While I was on the process, My

"Dear  Sir,
Thanks for your prompt response to my mail.This is a 
very urgent and trustworthy business transaction.
Like I said in my first letter, I am representing Mr.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky (m.k.) and would like to ask for your
partnership in re-profiling funds over US$450 million I
sent our current conversational status to Moscow and have
received the authority to proceed with you, and get some
clarifications both ways.
 Before I am able to give out the information that will
enable you access confidential data-pages of mikhail, I
would need some information as follows:
(1) What is your net worth?
(2) If you have problems, do they affect your activites you
undertake with us as an individual rather than a
corporate entity?
  
(3) Have you handled large funds, and was successfully?
All the answers will be kept very confidential. I must
explain why we are asking these questions: If you do have
existing profile problems, we may end up inheriting your
backlog thus creating a problem where none exist. We intend
to liquidate a large investment, and take the capital appr.
derivative to provide a new investment fund, under your
management, for future investments, thus negating any
requirements for taxation or declaration of process for
income generation. However, if you do have 
issues prior to this, it puts anything you do in the light,
and thus puts us in uncomfortable situation. As you see,
our assets are frozen in switzerland, and while we have
excess of USD5b lying there, we are unable to liquidate
them, or use them as guarantee for payment of the USD3.5b
lying there, we are unable to liquidate
them, or use them as guarantee for payment of the USD3.5b
backtaxes inflicted on us by the government. If the
situation does not improve, we shall be bankrupt before the
end of forth quarter this year. The funds being liquidated
arise from independent investments of the
group, outside the russian soil, so we can legitimately do
so, only if this is done quietly. If the authorites hear
about this, we shall have to tender it for hearing in
international judicial systems, and that will kill us.
Hence answer the questions in honesty, and let us know we
are confortable with you. We are trying to ensure that you
do not put us in any trouble, and likewise, we shall
provide you with an input as an entity with 
no history to the investment, only as a management
consultant. 
Everybody must be safe now and in the future, hence the
questions.
I represent Mr. Mikhail khordokovsky, the former C.E.O of
Yukos in Russia. I am sure you know of his predicaments
presently. this is why we need your help I received your
positive position hence this email to you based on his
advice. I am sure you are up to date with m.k and Mr. 
putin.Mr. p is intent in destroying m.k and his business
empire,We are working to get a break from the courts and we
will need all the cash call we can muster to hold our head
above waters in the coming days. The Gibraltar portfolio is
one of our arms yet to be infected by the Moscow led fed
tax offensive designed to bring us down and we need you to
help us keep it so. We need funds from this portfolio and
we can not get the funds on our own without arousing
moscow. To avoid this we need to completely reprofile the
funds from Gibraltar portfolio in your name so as to turn
away Moscow and their ally from us. The complete amount
available for you for reprofiling ispresently over $500m
and the 40% still stands. 
The new beneficiaries of the portfolio will need to offset
the back taxes to the authorites in Gibraltar and move the
funds online over the internet through a dedicated
confidential bank access that I will obtain from m.k in
Moscow through existing channel of communications. Once I 
get your name or company name, address, for identity
toreplace that of m.k and reprofile the portfolio
accordingly, then I will get the bank access across to you
to access the portfolio, pay the back taxes to the 
authorites and move the funds to another account we will
provide you in monte carlo and you keep the 40% as agreed.
please write back promptly.I will also suggest you visit
these news sites on the internet to be better informed
about this projet.

   I am Miss Marah sadija, former mistress to the son (Qusay) of the 
Iraqi former leader, Saddam Hussein.
  I am an Ethiopian, by birth and i am presently in a refugee camp in 
Zimbabwe, where the living conditions are unbearable.
   I do not wish to take your time with a lenghty mail, but i have to 
put this proposal to you so that you can assist me.
        While i was still in contact with Qusay,he made a deposit in my 
name to a security firm in Spain, which has an affiliate branch in 
Amsterdam.
This deposit was made in my name and the secret code and necessary 
documents are presently in the possession of an attorney, presently in 
London.
   This deposit was made in the form of a consigment and the content is 
a considerable amount of money in United state dollars which i cannot

willingness to assist me.
  I would be pleased and grateful to you if you could assist me in

Dear Sir,
My name is Mohammed Usman, I am from Iraq. My cousin was a
top officer in the former Government of Sadam Hussein.
Before the beginning war he gave me $25,000,000.00 (Twenty
five Million United States Dollars) to keep for him.
I managed to move the box containing the money out of Iraq
through diplomatic immunity to a Security company in
Holland and the box is been deposited as family treasure,
for security reasons. Now that the war is over I want to
move the money to your country for safety reasons. Be rest 
assured that this transaction is risk free as no person is
aware of this money. 
You will be compensated with 25% of the total sum, if you
can assist. 
Expecting your urgent reply via

Kelly White,

Please,copy reply to both of the following email addresses:
whitkel2@netscape.net,kwhity@37.com

Dear Sir,

IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR CO-OPERATION!

I write you this letter to solicit your help from Prison, as I am in dire
need.
I am Kelly White, a Captain in The British Army deployed to help facilitate
the forceful change of the Sadam HUSSEIN Regime in Iraq. I have been serving
in Iraq sincethe beginning
of the war. I was previously attached to a British Military Base in Germany
before my deployment to Iraq. I do hope you are not confused and distracted
by the fact that a strange person is writting you in confidence.
In the course of my stay in Iraq,I have withnessed so much
looting from which many colleagues have benefited (in excess of some Billions
of Dollars)and we have also benefit from. I
decided that I cannot afford to be left out of this great
opportunity to become a success, after a long hesitation.
This money is a part of the money that the regime of Sadam
Hussein,their friends and cronies had stolen and hidden in various parts
of Iraq before the war.It was now the responsibility of the U.S and British
soldiers to search for,recover this money and plough back into the governance
of Iraq. In the proccess,we were able to keep some away for
ourselves. Thats how the money came about.
Everything went well until I was accused arrested in 2004 alongside other
colleagues suspected to have abused inmates of prisons under the control
of Allied Forces in Iraq.
I initially thought that my stay in prison awaiting trial would be brief
but I have spent some months here without any change in my hopeless situation!
Now that I dont know how long I would stay here,and faced with the possibility
of dismissal from the Army if I am found guilty,I have come to reason that
it is only proper to try and make some kind of reliable contact who could
help me pick up
and safe-keep this money so that I dont lose everything I have saved during
my stay in Iraq.Who knows;such an opportunity,they say, comes once in a
lifetime!
My friends who did it before advised me that I just needed a contact(any
contact) outside Iraq to assure me that he could handle such an amount of
money,after which I would order it to be sent through for safe-keeping.
I have (hidden safely in Iraq) presently,the sum of US$21.7m. I only need
you,Sir,to guarantie me that I can still get this money back,if it is remitted
to you. I only need a person I can trust to safeguard this money since it
is not possible to leave here and do it myself. All the arragerment to transfer
it to you has been made by me before my arrest.Your only part
is to receive and safeguard it. We would further discuss on how the money
should be disbursed afterwards.
For your role in this business,I wish to compensate you
handsomely on successful conclussion of this assignment.I must only not
forget to tell you that secrecy and confidentiality in this business is
very important to both parties. It could put us in serious danger and even
compound my already complex problem, if this information is leaked to a
third party!It is therefore a matter of great importance to keep this secret
strictly between us even after the successful conclussion of this transaction.
I did not include my phone contact because any other contact is for the
military prison and therefore,tapped.This e-mail is the only private contact
I have here.I implore you to consider this proposal as urgently as possible
and give me a feedback. If you are in favour of my proposal,please,do include
your PRIVATE contact information - phone,fax,e-mail to facilitate a more
effective and confidential communication.
I implore you to ponder over this proposal as urgently as possible and get
back to me.
Do not forget to pray fervently for my acquitance.I wish you the best as
I await your reply.
Thanks,
Best Regards,
Kelly White(Capt).

FROM:MR.LI LE SONG
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Fu Shan Mansion
25 Taikoo Shing Road
Taikoo Shing Branch
Hong Kong.
(lilesong75@yahoo.com).



I am Mr. Li Le Song credit officer of the Foriegn operations dept of the
Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Taikoo Shing Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion
for
you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Colonel sadiq Uday who was with
the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18
calendar months, with a value of Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand
United state Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was
sent to
him, even during the war early last year. Again after the war another
notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out
that the
colonel and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit
their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Colonel
Sadiq Uday did not declare any next of kin in his,official papers including
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time
he
was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my !
bank. So, Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What
bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the
expiration 4
years  the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if
nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to
you
is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to
Colonel Sadiq Uday so that you will be able to receive his funds.


WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall
come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Colonel Sadiq
Uday,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me
with your
Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. 
After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for
claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be
provided
by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to
adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary
documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning
this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank
account
the sharing ratio is open for negotiation for you . Should you be interested
please send me your full names and current residential address and I will
prefers you to reach me on the email address below (lilesong75@yahoo.com)
and
finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this
operation.Your
earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.


Kind Regards,


Mr.Li Le Song.

Dear Sir,
With a very desperate need for assistance, I have summed up courage to contact
you. I am from (will disclose this later), presently working in Iraq with
an international organisation that I will also disclose later, I found your
contact particulars in an address journal. I am seeking your assistance
to evacuate the sum of (US$8.523 Million Dollars) Eight Million five Hundred
Thousand And Twenty Three Dollars to your country or any other safe country
of your choice, as far as I can be assured that my share will be safe in
your care untill I complete my service here,this is no stolen money, and
there are no dangers involved.

SOURCE OF MONEY:

Some money in various currencies was discovered concealed in barrels with
piles of weapons and ammunitions at a location near one of Saddam,s old
palaces during a rescue operation, and it was agreed by all party present
that the money be shared amongst us, this was quite an illegal thing to
do, but I tell you what? no compensation can make up for the risks we have
taken with our lives in this hell hole.

The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this kind of
money became a problem for me, so with the help of a German contact working
here, and his office enjoys some immunity, I was able to get the package
out to a safe cation entirely out of trouble spot. He does not know the
real contents of the package, and believes that it belongs to an Asian/American
who died in an air raid, and before giving up, trusted me to hand over the
package to his business associate. I have now found a secured way of getting
the package out to a safer country for you to pick up, and will discuss
this with you when I am sure that you are willing to assist me.

One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this matter with
a third party, should you have reasons to reject this offer, please destroy
this mail as any leakage of this information will be too bad for us.
I do not know for how long we will remain here, and I have survived 2 suicide
bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other reasons I will
mention later has prompted me to reach out for help, I honestly want this
matter to be resolved immediately. Please contact me as soon as
possible.

Regards,
Ali Ibrahim

"Good day, My name is James Clapham and I am a British soldier 
with the United Nations. I have some personal thing that I want 
to discuss with you which requires a matured mind, good understanding 
and a good sense of judgment.  
 
About three weeks ago, I met this helpless and peaceful lady by 
the name of Nada Dalal Nayif in Baghdad; she is a widow with 5 
children. She narrated her ordeal and the suffering she and her 
children had been going through.Nada Dahal told me that her husband 
was killed by Sadam Hussein's son Qusay some months long before 
USA came to save Iraq from the hands of the dictators.   
 
Her late husband was from the generation of Nayif-Da'ud group who 
were taken out of power by Saddam Hussein the mid 60s. Her husband 
became one of Sadam Hussein�s business friends after many years 
later. Just before her husband was murdered, saddam had given her 
husband some huge amount of money,($97 million dollars ) as part of 
the money which saddam wanted him to use in procuring arms, ammunitions 
and other ballistic materials for sophisticated war weapons. Nada 
revealed to me that her husband did not support saddam's motives and 
decided not to get involved in the
purchase of these weapons, so he decided to bury the money underground. 
it was her husband's refusal to cooperate with saddam's evil plans of 
war that led them to murder him in cold blood. 
 
During the war Iraq, she struggled to move the money along with the 
help of her children and headed towards the borders; they did well 
to dress and package the money in a way that nobody will ever know. 
Nada has confidently revealed the where about of the money to me. 
She wants to 
finally leave Iraq for good since there is no peace here, they live 
in fear and trepidation because some of saddam's loyalists and insurgents 
who are still in hidding are still creating havoc and hunting people 
such as the Nayif's family. The helpless woman needs our assistance 
to relocate with her children, to a peaceful country where she says 
they can change there religion and live without fear.  
 
I have contacted you because I need someone to assist me receive and 
keep this money while I plot their migration. I am just an ordinary 
soldier and I have will be court martial led if I ever handled such 
huge kind of money, I must confess that I do not know how to secure 
the money in term of investment. I have contacted you because I cannot 
directly move this money out of here and into my country and I am 
completely handicap due to my regimented life as a soldier, moreover 
most of us are being screened from time to time because of past 
incidents of soldier and marines who have been caught and court 
martial led for raiding and stealing Gold and other expensive 
jewelries from Saddam's palaces.  
  
I am working on how to move this money out of the country to a peaceful 
place where it will be in safe hands and I have done a perfect homework 
on this arrangement. I contacted you because I can not move this money 
directly into my country because of our involvement in the war and the 
constant checks on us during entry into our country. But with my position 
here, I have made perfect plans to move the money out of Iraq to Europe 
through one of United Nations cargo operations unit that constantly 
moves in and out of Iraq. 
 
I will need you to help me receive and keep this money and if possible 
assist me help Nada and her children prepare a safe home, although you 
are not obliged to do so as i am personally making serious alternative 
plans to move her family out of Iraq on my own. So i need to know if we 
can work this out as she is willing to compensate your richly for your 
help and this too affords me a lifetime opportunity. I would plead and 
advice that you keep all facts concerning this discussion between you 
and I alone considering my own involvement here in Iraq. 

All correspondents should be forwarded to the email:jclapham@post.cz 
I will be waiting to hear form you soon.

tudorvlad@excite.com

I am Mr. TUDOR VLAD, Bank Manager of The Savings Bank
Of Russian Federation, Kiovsky Branch,Samara
. I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you.

On February 9, 2001, An American International
Evangelist Pastor John Kelley, made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at
US$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) in my
branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification
to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a
month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his associates in Baghdad Iraq. The Baptist
Family that Pastor John Kelley was killed in a sniper
attack just outside of Baghdad,Traveling with a group
of pastors from across the Northeast on a two-week
mission to bring Arabic Bibles to the people of Iraq.

You will get more details at
http://www.turnto10.com/news/2848947/detail.html

On further investigation, I found out that he died
without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his
next of kin failed. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that he did not declare
any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This
sum of US$15,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank
and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever come forward to claim it.According to Laws of
Republic of Russian ederation, at the expiration of 5
(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Russian Government if nobody applies to claim
the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to this late
Man, so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide
immediately your full names and address so that the
attorney will prepare the necessary documents that
will put you in place as the next of kin.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain
the necessary documents and letter in your favor for
the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world
that you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next
of kin. The money will be paid into your account for
us to share in the ratio of 70% for me 30% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.If you are
interested, please reply immediately via the private
email
address above. Upon your response, I shall then
provide you with more details and relevant documents
that will help you understand the transaction.

"We are a Law/Financial consulting firm based in the UK. Due to the scope of our work, we have affiliations in the corporate field. Our aim of writing you amongst others is to bring to your notice our ability to secure contracts in the ongoing Iraqi rebuilding process. That is; overseeing bidding with your registered company, for a contract in Iraq. 

The caliber of contracts which we have the ability to secure a successful bid, would have a profit margin ranging between $1M to $20M, and has an execution life span of not more than 30days. The entire process is totally transparent. 

Below is brief itemization of the entire process; 

Your company would have to be registered with The Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov ). This is compulsory for all US originated (USAID) contracts. Take note that the foundations of rebuilding Iraq are mostly US aided. 
We shall register a branch of your company with the Ministry of Trade in Iraq. A visit to the web link <http://www.iraqcoalition.org/economy would update you on what the registration entails. 
We shall thereafter proceed to bid for a contract and through our contact, ensure a successful award. Examples of contract tenders on offer can be located by ‘searching’ rebuilding Iraq (www.rebuilding-iraq.net ) on any search engine. Once there, you should ""click"" on ""New solicitations"" and this would bring you to a list of the present contracts on offer. 
We shall also provide a prospective contractor on ground in Iraq that would immediately buy off the contract from you. 

The entire 1 - 4 process would take place within the 30 day period. We are equally responsible for acting in a fiduciary capacity for you. We are the ones that would be on ground to handle the entire official course of action. For your safety, you do not have to set ""foot"" in Iraq, except you prefer to do so. 

We believe we have been very comprehensive as it concerns this project. You would be astounded at what you would discover if you decide to verify the information stated above. Take advantage of the endless contract opportunities in Iraq. We are certain that you must have asked yourself why the depth of US involvement in Iraq. This is a bona fide project. 

We await your swift positive response. We are a credible law firm, hence you can be assured that we would emphasize for all processes to be implemented rightfully to guarantee a fertile project.

Dear sir/madam.

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is PATRICK DUKE a merchant in Dubai,in
the U.A.E.I worked with Kuwait oil Company and
eight years as a contractor,I have been diagnosed
with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of
medical treatment, and right now I have only about
a few months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focused on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come
to this world I would live my life a different way
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called
me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family
members as well as a few close friends.
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close
one of my accounts and distribute the money which I
have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the
huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars
$18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect
this deposit and dispatched it to charity
organizations.
I dont want a situation where this money will be used
in
an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this
bold
decision. I am not afraid of death hence I  know where
I
am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom
of
the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will
fight
my case and I shall hold my peace.I shall give you
more
details once you reply this mail.
I have set aside 20% for you and for your time 
God be with you.

"My dear friend,
I have received your mail and i must first of all show my
appreciation ,over the fact that you have given heed to the entreaty
of a dying man.
Like i had told you in my previous mail, i lived a very reckless life
when it mattered most. All i thought about was my various
investments,it is that same care free attitude that is going to cost
me a lot now.
When i discovered this ailment, it dawned on me that i had been
living a very vain life.Then the need to affect the lives of those in
need became very paramount in my thoughts.This appears to be a case
of mercy after death as i no longer have the strength to do those
things i used to do when i was still very full of life.
My dear friend , in my resolve to actualise my dying wish, i have
been able to support charity to a very large extentaround the middle
east and europe.Then my health became a sorry tale, that at this
particular point in time, i live at the mercy of various drugs and
operations which certainly can not remedy anything.My close family
members are however not happy with the way i have disbursed
everything of mine to the motherless babies and the less
priviledged.That was why they failed to help me actualise my dream of
supporting charity.
They held for themselves the funds i made available and went as far
as even trying to terminate my life when the hour(though very short
)has not come.All relationship with me has been severed ,and they are
of the opinion that the last of my fortune has been
spent.Incidentally, the sum of twenty four million dollars(united
states) lies in a security company in Europe , and well packaged in a
consignment. That is the last i have here on earth after my medical
bills have been estimated and all expenses paid pending when i shall
be no more.These funds i wish to entrust to you , to help propagate
the works of charity where ever your location is.By so doing, i would
need your utmost sincerity and honesty to carry the venture along
successfully.
It would be required of you to furnish me with your full names and
address,telephone and fax numbers , to enable me put a letter to the
security company, making you the eligible beneficiary to the funds
with them.
Once this is done,you shall make arrangements with them on how the
funds would be transfered to your location.I beg of you to deal with
me honestly and render me your assistance to the fullest of your
capacity.you would be helpng a dying man.Most importantly you would
be touching the lives of a huge number of people.I hope i would be
able to count on you while i wait impatiently for the time to come.My
bones are slowly cleaving to my skin.I hope to hear from you as soon
as possible.
Warmest Regards,
Larry Moore

Dear Firstname  , 

I sincerely hope that after you read this mail you will respond to my call,let me start by introducing myself my name is Robert Mark. i'm 65 years old ,a british living in Dakar ( Senegal). 

I am a businessman and owns two companies here in Dakar, married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago but before this happened my business and concern for making money was all i lived for i never really cared about other values in life but since the loss of my family, i have found a new desire to assist helpless familes. i have been helping orphans in motherless homes, i have donated some money to orphans in sudan, south africa, cameroun, brazil, spain, austria germany and some asian countries. Before i became ill, i kept some money, ten and a half million dollars ($10.5million) to be precise in a long term deposit account in a security company in Spain . 

Presently, i'm in a hospital my doctor told me i have prostate cancer that i have a few months to live.it is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations. because so much of my wealth has been plundered by relatives and friends since my illness,hence i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them since the money in the security company is the last fund that i have left. Right now i am partialy stranded in the hospital due to the nature of my sickness so i am appealing to you to help me collect the deposit from the security company in Spain and distribute it amongst charity organizations. I would want you to use your discretion to distribute the money and keep 10% of it for yourself. 

Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you might have incured during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. May the good Lord bless you and your family. 

Please reply to this mail robert_heritage02@yahoo.com as i can only communicate through my laptop which is by my bed,as soon as i get your response i shall then give you the necessary informations you need to collect this money

Dear friend,
 This letter might come to you as a surprise as we have not met
before,but I believe that you would be compelled to help me after
going through the contents of this letter.
 My name is Mr Pater Lawson,a divorcee, I am a Zimbabwean. I am a
farmer in Zimbabwe.
 Basically, I was involved in Agricultural production,until
August (2003), when the government of Robert Mugabe decided to
seize all farm-land(s) owned by whites in Zimabwe (without
compensation). He (Robert Mugabe) did not stop at that; he also
went on to expel all White farmers in Zimbabwe.He implored the
services of his war veterans to undertake this seizure. The war
veterans have been accused (correctly) of being behind the
violent occupation of white-owned commercial farms in which an
estimated 70,000 farm workers have been displaced. At least, over
hundreds white farmers and black settlers have been killed since
the farm invasions began in February 2000.
 As at this momemt, most of us have grudgingly gone back to
Europe,while some (a few) of us are still in Zimbabwe.We have
decided that we must see this problem to the end. Although we
know that we are taking a great risk by staying here in Zimbabwe.
A the moment, our phone lines are bugged,and all our movements
are being monitored by Zimbabwes (Robert Mugabe4s)secret Police.
Therefore email is the safest means of communication for now.
 We (White farmers in Zimbabwe) have taken our case to the United
Nations,and even with the threats of sanctions and the subsequent
sanctions from the West against the Zimbabwean Authorities,
Robert Mugabe (The President of Zimbabwe) still remains adamant.
He is insisting that our farm land (some of which we bought with
our money and most of which We inherited from our fathers)
belongs to the (his) government of Zimbabwe.
 Anyway, as soon as I heard the rumour about the possible seizure
of Ourfarm land(s) and Our subsequent expulsion from Zimbabwe,I
immediately soldpart of my farm land and withdrew all the money I
had in Zimbabwean banks (Both savings and current account).
 Since I could not keep the money in Zimbabwe, I used the
services of a Diplomatic Courier Company to move this money
(registered as official documents) out of Zimbabwe to Europe.At
present, my money totalling US$28,750,000. (Twenty eight million,
seven hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollars) is in
Europe and hopefully, it would be paid into an offshore account.
Can you help me? Are you trustworthy? Can you handle this money?
Are you capable of handling this money?
 If you can, please contact me 
 All you need to do is to claim this money from the Courier
Company. You will be required to contact the Courier Company that
moved this money (official documents) out of Zimbabwe and to
Europe.
 All necessary particulars which can facilitate and enable you
claim the money on my behalf will be forwarded to you as soon as
your consent to  proceed is received.
 For your assistance, you will be entitled to 20% of the total
sum. You are also obliged to help/advise on the proper and most
convenient way of investing this money in your country, since
this money cannot be brought back in cash to the Country of
origin.
 Hopefully, You will consider this request and respond
positively. If you
 are still in doubt after the receipt of this mail, please do not
hesitate
 to contact me and ask question(s) that might hinder your
decision on this matter.

 I await your favourable response.
 yours sincerely,
 Mr  Peter Lawson",0,0,1,0,0

Subject: proposal

Dearest Good 

a thing to write you. I have a proposal for you, this however is not 
mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your 
will. Your profile pushed me to send you this form of proposal. I am Miss 
susan malley, 19 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr. 
And Mrs. susan malley. My father was a highly reputable business magnet 
(Cocoa Merchant) who operated in the capital of Ivory Coast Western 
region of Africa.

 It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one 
of his business trips abroad, on 12th February 2002. Though his sudden 
death was rather suspected to have been master minded by an uncle of 
his, who traveled with him to France, the Almighty God Knows Better. My 
mother at the other hand, died when I was just 4 years old and ever since 
then, my father has been the only person to have participated in my life. 
He was a good father and our bound became very strong and special. 
However, before his death, he called his secretary who accompanied him 
to the hospital and told him that he has a sum of Eighteen Million United 
State Dollars (US$18.000.000.00) left in one of the leading security 
company abroad (Europe). He went ahead and issued a written instruction 
to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all of the necessary documents 
related to this fund that was sealed and deposited with a trunk box.
 I am just 19 years old years old and a university undergraduate and really 
do not know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs 
as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory Coast. The death of my 
father actually brought sorrow in my life, I have been constantly being 
harassed by both his uncles and brothers who are in bid for his fortunes. 
I am sending this proposal through my father's secretary who is presently 
in Europe to seek for a reputable individual to help and invest this fund. 
Again, I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in these regards.
 Your suggestions and ideas will be highly appreciated as I surely will like 
to invest abroad and into a profitable business venture. Furthermore, permit 
me to ask these questions. 1. Can I completely trust that you will take me 
as your daughter? 2. What percentage of the total amount will be good for 
you if you do not wish to participate in my life but do wish to invest the 
fund in a good business. 3. What kind of a business venture do you intend 
to invest it in? and how profitable is it annually?.

 Please consider and get back to me through my email below for further 
details. Best regards,

MISS  susan malley.

Dear Sir,
 
I am the Chairman of the Contract Award Committee of the Petroluem and

may not wish to disclose how I got your email address for now.

After due deliberation with my partner, I decided to forward to you this 
business proposal, we want you to assist us receive the sum of
Twenty eight million, six hundred thousand united state bills
(us28.6m) into your account. This fund resulted from an over-invoiced 
contract awarded by us under the budget allocation to my ministry and the 
bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries. The contract was 
executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid his actual cost of the 
contract.
 
Now, we are left with the balance of us28.6m as the over invoiced amount, which 
we have deliberately over estimated for our own use. Please note that the 
law forbids civil servants to operate or own foreign accounts hence this 
contact,we have agreed to share the money in the following percentages: 30 
for you, 60 for us 10 for tax as may be required by your government.

Note that this transaction is very much free from all sorts of risk hence 
the business was carefully planned before it was successfully executed and 
we the officials involved in the deal have put many years in service to our 
ministry.We have been exercising patience for this privilege for so long not until 
the presidential announcement last week that all foreign contractors owed be 
paid forthwith, this will enable the presidential tax force reconcile our 
debt ratio with the outside world especially now that we are begging for 
dept forgiveness from our foreign creditors.To most of us involved in this deal its a life 
time blessing we cannot afford to miss. Upon indication of your interest to 
fully co-operate with us, a payment application/information form will be 
sent to you via email for completion.
 
Note that the following information: a) your private phone and fax number and email address 
will enable us seek/secure approval of the fund from the concerned 
government quarters/ministries within 3-4 banking days.
 
As soon as we confirm receipt of this money in your nominated bank account, 
my partner and I will come over to your country to arrange for our own share 
and possibly invest part of this money in your country.
 
Let honesty and trust be our watchword throughout this transaction. I shall 
furnish you with some details about myself. Your prompt reply will be highly
appreciated.

Best regards.
Michael

"Dear Sir/Ma,
                                TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

My name is Barrister Oki Michael Reyes, a solicitor and advocate of the 
law.Five years ago I stood for a client who bided for a contract to supply 
Aviation Gadgets to the Federal Ministry of Transport and Aviation (F.M.T.A) 
in Nigeria.

The contract was executed and the total amount involved was $19.5Million. 
Part of this money (10Million) has been paid to my client and ever since I 
have been negotiating the release of the balance of  $9Million which is now 
ready for payment but Unfortunately my client died of heart related illness 
on the 22nd of November 2004.The Federal Ministry fo Transport and Aviation 
(F.M.T.A) need Somebody whom I can recommend as a Relative or Business 
Associate in order to release this fund. Since I need part of this money, I 
suggested that I present you to stand as a Business Associate of my late 
client so that the fund will be released to you.

As lawyer and Advocate of the law, I will put all papers in order to making 
sure that the law is not breached. Negotiation is open to you to determine 
your compensation for your involvement in this financial project. You are 
also free to ask questions on the area(s) you are not cleared.

I will be glad to read from you.

Yours faithfully,

I took the vehicle to Canadian Tire recently for a Safety.  The only 
reason it did not pass was the rust holes in the fenders.  The 
mechanic confirmed that the ABS is not necessary as far as Safety goes, 
because the normal brakes are all that is required.

However,My client made out a certified cashiers check of($23000) before 
he travelled to japan on a business trip,for a previous car and its 
shipment charges etc,but it was unfortunately sold.The amount on the check 
he deposited for the car is bigger than what should  be paid to you 
now, so the check is now meant for the total expenses  which includes the 
purchase of your car,the pick up of the car from its  present location 
and the shipping charges/other necessary shipping  arrangements. 
However he has instructed us to carry on with this transaction. So you're 
required to deduct the cost of your car ($2000)and send the balance 
of($8000) to my client  via western union money transfer to enable him 
offsett shipping charges/arrangements.once the transaction is  concluded,My 
agent will be coming for the pick up of the car from its present

arrangements,while title papers and other necessary documets will be sent by

Hello,

Saw the ad for the sale of your car and I am
intrested in making the
purchase. If true to 
how it was described, I will appreciate if you can
send pics of it to my
email. I am currently 
in the United States.

I had already paid an Associate of mine to help get
another car but it was
sold before he 
could meet up with the seller. I will ask him to
make a cheque which will
be sent to you for 
payment. The amount on the cheque will be more than
what you are offering
because the other  one my Associate was to help me
get was more expensive
than your's. 

The Amount on the check will be 8,500 Euros.

All you will need do is to remit the difference to
my Shipper who will in
turn come with authorisation  from me for pick up. 

If this is ok by you, respond to my email with the
following information so
the cheque can 
be sent to you as soon as possible.

1) FULL NAMES (as you will want it to appear on the
cheque)

2) COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS

3) CONTACT PHONE NUMBER

I will be looking forward to hear from you soon.

"Dear Jane,
Thank you so much for your email. It was really appreciated. I will want
you to know that I am still intrested in your car. Th ad I saw is on
Annuntri.com, it was really nice. 
 
Regarding the payment, I wll want to know if the check should be sent to
you very soon you will remit the rest, I believe this is very important. So
as to avoid any disparity in the deal. 
 
I must not fail to let you know that I really like your car very much and
would have loved to come and pick it up personally, but I cannot because my
wife has been sick for sometime. She has had Cancer(Breast) for sometime
now and I have to be with her in the United States where she is receiving
treatment. Hope you understand?
 
As soon as you get the check, I will want you to take it to the bank and
immediately remitt the rest to the shipper through Western Union Money
Transfer in the U.K. so he can come and pick up the car as soon as possible
because the shipper is prepaid and I will want the whole thing settled. The
shipper will come with Authorisation from me. 
 
I really have to get the car because my only son will be home for christmas
as he is to start school in the new year and I will want the car in the U.K
before then because my son's 18 Birthday is on Christmas day and I will
really love to make him happy while his mother is not around. According to
what you said the deal is very complicated but I do not seem to have a
choice.
 
I tried calling my Associate but his phone but couldn't get through. I will
make sure you get the check soon anyway. Even if he is not in the country.
I will make sure I contact him and he sends the check to you.
 
Having gone through your email , I realised you did not include your
information as requested Information
 
I will want you to please make your Complete Mailing Address  very explcit,
so the check can get to you early enough.

"Dear Faithful Servant of God,
  Greetings to you in the Name of our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ. My name is Evangelist
  Okugbe Edekie, the founder of Goodnews Ministry  Inc located in Edo State, Nigeria far away
  Africa. This Church was founded in the Year 2004 and I have passion for the lost souls because
  the harvest is truly plenteous but the laborers are few. By the grace of God, I am married and
  blessed with wonderful Children.
  There is a great price to pay in the work of soul winning. It is very clear that our responsibility
  is to evangelize to people for Christ. Lost sinners must be brought to the place of repentance
  towards God and faith in Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20, mark 16:14-18) (Acts 2:37-38). To
  achieve this goal for every convert, we must have the concern of a father (1 corith 4:15), the
  travail of a mother (Gal 4:19), the sacrifice of a lover (2 corith 12:15), the gentleness of a nurse.
  (1 thess 2:7-9), the endurance of a soldiers (2 Tim 2:3,4) and Jealousy of a friend (2 corith
  11:2).
  Goodnews Ministry  Inc has a target for converts (Matthew 28:19,20;Mk 16:16; Eph 4:11-16; Col 1:21-29)
When Jesus Christ sent forth His Apostle to evangelize the world, He did not commission them
  merely to preach but really to find the lost (Lk 15:4-7), bear much fruit (Jn 15:8,16) and fill the
  gospel net with fish (Lk 5:4,6,10). We cannot fulfill our task if we do not keep this target or goal
  before us. The Lord Jesus Christ is our supreme Example in the work of soul winning (Lk 19:10;
  1Tim 1; 15). The motive behind everything He did (healing the sick, feeding the crowds,
  preaching the gospel e.t.c) was to prepare the heart for the experience of salvation, to bring men
  into the right relationship to God. In an atmosphere of hatred, antagonism and hostility, He won
  multitude to God (Matt 12:10-21).
  We have great need for Bibles for our Precious Converts who are not able to buy a copy of
  Large Print Bibles due to their sight and they are in the Prison and rural communities. Kindly
  send us 27 large Print Bibles of KJV Version for the Converts and what a blessing to have these
  materials shipped directly from your ministry.
  I would love to work with you in Spreading God's message here in my country because our
  mission and vision is to see that lost souls are converted and thereby depopulating the kingdom
  of Satan. And there are seven Children who are in our Orphanage Home and Please be
praying for them that God Almighty will use them as well in reaching out to their
fellow mates in the Community where we live.
  Thanks and may the grace of God be with you all. I look forward to hearing from you on how you
  can help us with these materials to expand God's work. My regards to your family and the
  wonderful Congregation the Lord Has given to you. We would be very much glad to welcome to
  my Country this year 2007, if the Lord directs you to come and join my ministry in Soul Wining.
  Yours in the missionary field,

"Dear Beloved in Christ, 
I pray this letter finds you in the power and anointing of the almighty father Jesus Christ and the God of all nations, grace, peace who inspects all blessing and favor, who called you to his own external life in glory of our lord Jesus Christ. 
My beloved, it takes us years to come together as a Christian in the community of Ugbor, we manage to have a fellowship center in the community, some years back, my members and I went to near by village for evangelism, {which is Oben village} As we got there, they drove us away at first but we do not relent to preach to them and some of them were ready to listen, those who listen repented and become a Christian, meanwhile the community is a Muslim community, by the time the head of the Muslim realized that there were no much people in his mosque again, them he sent some of his member to our community to destroy our church building, steal the church instrument and two of our members were killed, may their soul rest in perfect peace and I believe that they are resting with our lord Jesus Christ, after they have come to destroy, the young convert ran out of the community to our community because the Muslim promise to killed them but I believe that the almighty Jesus Christ is in control of their lives and the Muslim cannot come closer to them, please my beloved, help us to pray for them. 
Beloved in Christ, I beg you in the name of our beloved father in heaven Jesus Christ for you to render support to the church in need of study materials, such as study bibles, cd""s, tapes and others available study books in your ministry, please beloved these materials are for the new Muslim converts so they can grow stronger in faith, please beloved, if there is any other way you can still be of help and also, God is going to protect us from those so call Muslim, I believe that by the power of the almighty God, all members of the Muslim is going to repent and become a Christian. Please beloved; the church will be very happy for your support in any way you wish to render help to us. Please do not forget to pray for those Muslim for repentance and we are also praying for them too. 
Thanks and God bless you, may you continue to rest faithfully in lord, darkness is falling, and let us works together while we may press on with Jesus Christ. We hope to hear from you in Jesus name! Amen.

Dear Beloved in Christ,
My heartfelt and loving greetings to you in the most highly exalted name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
I am M. Sreenivasa Rao from Dindi which is on the costal belt of Andhra Pradesh State in India. I got one ministry. It is a registered organization with our Government from our Ministry. I am doing outreach gospel running one orphanage with 19 orphan Children's maintaining one library and conducting some relief programs towards destitute people. Basically I laid my stress on the outreach gospel along with my co-gospel workers. There are some
for corners at our area where the voice of God is not known to such residents. They are all dwelling with Hindu religion. For such people we are endearing our gospel and we distribute some books on scripture. Really the areas are all too back ward. For some times there are no proper transport facilities at least
generally we used to go by walk to such places. We had 7 Co-pastors to absolute on outreach gospel. If we got provided even by bicycles we shall speed up our outreach task in an effective manner. Actually each bicycle takes cost of $50, and we are suffering lack of such sufficient budget in purchasing them you.Kindly pray to God about our outreach gospel task and try to
support us on purchasing of bicycles which shall be quite useful
for our daily need. our orphanage is running with 19 orphan children. Where we are facing number of problems in maintaining it. Frequently we are
facing very miserable troubles in meeting of its basic needs. Because of this condition our orphan children are sustaining with bitter and panic conditions. You kindly look into the basic needs of our orphans and try to assist us accordingly initially we need bibles, reading books, tracts and pen and pencils towards our orphan children. We are now praying to God in arranging of such
goods are feeling that our meet as the right motivation of God. We are hopefully awaiting at your kind response on our present day needs. You kindly pray to God about our orphan children and try  to support them as I caderised above. They shall be every grateful to you on your gracious support. Our library named ""Faith Library"" full filling the day wise needs of our readers. Particularly number of Hindu people is making use of its services regularly. But we are lacking
sufficient furniture and more volumes, which are quite needed for it for this praying to God to arrange such help from any heavenly presence like you. You kindly pray to God about our library task in India. Finally I am operating one relief scheme for the upliftment of destitute people like aged persons and widows that is ""Food For Destitute "". On every Sunday I used to implement this scheme. On that day I arrange food and some pocket money towards these
helpless destitute people due to lack of sufficient budget. I am implementing this only on Sundays. If I got provided with full pledged support them I shall make it implement for all days in a weeks. Basically these are our present day tasks from our ministry. Our outreach gospel is yielding very good harvest on
Hindu people. Our orphan children's is growing on Godly lines but they are suffering lack of basic needs. Our library task is on satisfactory way. Where we are in need of some more books and furniture. Our relief program on destitute people is going to be implemented on Sundays only. In catering of your  gracious support.
You kindly suggest me on our ministry activities. I need your leadership. I hope in receiving your early response on my present day tasks. Who He is kind to the poor lends to the Lord (Proverbs 19:17). He who mocks the poor shows contempt for their maker (proverbs 17:5). My cordial wishes to you and to your people. Our church people, co-pastors are greeting you in heartfelt way.
Orphan children are sending their love and kisses to you. I await at your prayerful and favorable reply on our need as I narrated to you.

Thanking you in Jesus,

Your brother in Christ,

Subject: Cry for salvation( bibles)

Dear My Beloved 
May the Peace of the Lord be with you all. It is great and wonderful to give the good report of our Lord miraculous power to you and every members of your Ministry. At the beginning of this year our Lord Jesus Christ began to appear to me in the air with the glory of God, going in all directions. I stepped into footprints and started walking, walking in His spirit, walking and seeing, through the Holy Spirit, the Towns and Villages, the people that must be won for Him. Now those steps led my Team and I to Ovia south east local government Community here in Edo state. Here we hold crusade and feed more than twenty thousand people. This Village community crusade was such an important mission that the Lord prepared me and my team for them in a special way, visiting us with His presence. In His visitation the wind of the Holy Spirit blew over the land, blowing the way the wind of the spirit must have blown on the day of Pentecost. I had never witnessed it blowing like it was in my vision. Surely throughout the world the winds of Pentecost will blow like that in this final hour. Beloved when my team and I landed in these Village communities my heart was thrilled as I stepped down from the bicycle into the strong blowing wind. I thought, ""It's like the winds of Pentecost were blowing in my vision"". The Lord had indeed prepared us to take His message and His truth to a people desperate in their need for the reality of His Love. All that God had shown me in the vision and more took place in these communities that has become such a stronghold of Muslim town (Islamic), Idol worshiping and false doctrine. As my team and I move around the communities immediately we arrive, I knew that we were sent of God and nothing could defeat us or the crusade. We were invading the stronghold of the devil, invading the community where the devil has more control, than any other community in our Nation. We were told that ninety percent of the people dwelling in this community involved with Islamic worshiping (Muslims) and Idol worshiping. The Islamic and Idol worshipers in this community has become so entwined with Christianity that most of the people cannot separate God from the devil. We were told that the two different rulers of these communities have given these communities to the devil with blood sacrifices, possibly human blood. These are Village communities chained in darkness for hundreds of years, communities whose history is one of continuous rebellion and atrocities in our Nation. We were also told about a certain market where one could buy human flesh. Think of it human flesh available to the buyer. How do they get it? Murder, death by malnutrition and related disease. Beloved we cried out in desperation. Yes, we fed more than twenty thousand people but the only one who can really help them out of their bondages is JESUS. Revelation 21:8, ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."" On the first night God touched upon this verse in a great way and on the last night it came forth with overwhelming force and power because God is tired of people's sins. Truly we had a taste of the sword, God's word divided right from wrong as God poured His convicting power down on the crowed, with the winds of Pentecost and His greatness. Beloved in a minute thousand came to Christ looking to Him, Crying out for Him. It was a wonderful sight to behold indeed. Through the spirit of God the murderers began to be called out. The Lord told me about a woman in the crowd, who murdered her twins babies and also a man who murdered his neighbor, poisoned him and covered it up, putting the blame on someone else. Another person has had to suffer for his crime. Beloved I have never seen God moved the way He moved that night, uncovering sins one after another, hideous crimes. Beloved we thank God for the wonderful work you are doing to support ministries like ours. We pray, may our Lord Jesus Christ continue to keep your work for His grace. Beloved as you can see we are urgently in need of 14 Study Bibles and 10 Large Print Bibles and some other study materials. We wish to request 34 bibles for 34 HIV/AIDS victims in this community who accepted Christ. This people do not have money to purchase Bible for themselves. They are highly in need. Please help us to help these souls. Thanks and God bless you. We hope to hear from you very soon.

"Dear brother in Christ,
Greetings in Jesus highly exalted name. It is my great pleasure to meet you through this e-mail. Here I would like to introduce myself as 
Pastor CH.Narasaiah, from Guntur District, Andhra Parades. I was born and brought up in a Hindu family. My father name is krishnamurthy who is God trinity in the Hinduism and my mother name is Rosamma also a Hindu name. I am only the one son to my parents so they loved me very much from my childhood. As a Hindu boy I used to read our Holy book Bhagavat Geeta. After I grew up 18 years old I started to think who is real God because Hindu religion not gives me any satisfaction and makes me confusion reason of many Gods over one thousand. Since 19 years I started to read other Holy books like Qumran, Bible Buddhism and some other world's faiths. I found truth in the Bible only. Mostly these scriptures inspired me. 
God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son, which whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life john. 3:16. God demonstrates His own live towards us, in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us. Rom. 5: 8.For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of god Rom. 3:23.For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus is our Lord. Rom. 6:23.But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become the children of God, to those who believe in His name. John. 1:12. The Word of God inspires me. The birth of Jesus Christ, His miracles, signs, no one speaks that he is God or Son of God except Jesus Christ. Jesus said I am the way truth and the life. He said that he has authority to forgive sins. After reading Bible I came to know Jesus Christ is the Son of God and through His blood we have eternal life. I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior on 1st July 65 and I took baptism 11th January 1966 by pastor p.chinnayasuri. For 3 years I worked as a government employ and I gave resign to that job when God called me to do His work among unreached villages in the year of 1970. 
I could establish three churches in deferent places of our surroundings with my own money every year we will conduct Gospel Open Air meetings at our Churches. So, we request you to come and bless us with the Living word of God. So that my country India would be filled with God's love and mercy. Presently we are running one orphanage home with 13 children we are strongly praying for their basic and daily needs. Because they are struggling for the food and clothes. Please I kindly inform you take little bit of your valuable time and pray and do some gracious help for them. If you give your postal address we will send our ministry we all are praying for you and for your family. 
I hope this is not accidental but by God's grace only we able to contact you. If you want to know more about us, please write us we will send more information to you in our next mail. Therefore I request you all to up hold us in your valuable prayers. And please share with your friends, relatives and church members. All our church members and orphan children are sending their hearty wishes and sweet hugs to you. Closing here with lots of love and prayers. Eagerly waiting for your gracious reply.

Date: 20th Jan 2006.
FROM THE DESK OF: NUHU RIBADU 
ATTN: BENEFICIARY,
 
 
                   RE: BE CAREFUL OF THE HUDLOOMS
 
Following the recent broadcast of the president and the commander in chief of armed forces of the federal republic of Nigeria during the visit to the America President Mr. George W. Bush, his speech to the united nation, couple with recommendation and resolution of his last visit to South Africa, British, France and the UNGA United Nations General Assembly in New York), a total sum of $2.8 Billion has been mapped out by the SENATE to settle all outstanding foreign debts owned to contractor this year. 
 
It has therefore become imperative for us to explore our options for reducing our debt servicing policy to affordable and sustainable levels. On the order of the president as a mark of his reconciliation and image laundering exercise toward sanitizing the battered image of the federal republic of Nigeria abroad. 
 
I am Nuhu Ribadu Chairman Economic And Financial Crime Commission, a committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria under the able President Olusegun Obasanjo. The purpose of the committee among other is to investigate, verify and settle all outstanding debts owed to foreign contractors whose payment is overdue. During the last military dictatorship of Late General Sani Abacha, many abnormalities had happened in the Central Bank of Nigeria and Union Bank of Nigeria where some top official of the apex Bank collaborate with imposters and abandon our contractor half way with levies and taxes.
 
Consequently, we received a directive from the office of the president, ordering the above office to settle all genuine contractors whose debts has been outstanding for a long time now. These are those who has shown sufficient proof regarding the release of their fund, And we wish to inform you that in our record here, you have fulfilled such conditions.
 
But the reasons why your own Transfer has to be delayed is because, there is presently a counter claims on your funds by one Mr. Peter Woo, who is presently trying to make us believe that you entered into an agreement with him, to help you in receiving your fund, in his bank account in China. So here comes the big question. Did you sign any Deed of Assignment in favor of Mr. Peter Woo, thereby making him the current beneficiary with the following account details: Account Name: Indo-China Group Ltd, A/C #: USD114-102-5567-8, Bank Name: Standard Chattered bank, 138-141 1st Floor, Edinburgh Tower, the Landmark, 15 Queens Road, Central Hong Kong, Swift Code: SCBL 11k111.
 
If you did not sign, nor authorize Mr. Peter Woo to receive your payment on your behalf, kindly reconfirm to us, your genuine bank account details, to avoid making payment to a wrong person, attempt to divert your payment to a new account without your knowledge may have been done by your local representative with the assistance of some (Union Bank of Nigeria) Officials, of whom most of them are presently under our custody and will face prosecution under section 35A sub section 1-2-4 of the criminal code of Nigeria, pending on when we finish with our investigation. 
 
This office is glad to inform you that your payment shall be made as soon as this information needed from you is submitted, either by Telegraphic Transfer or by international Certified Bank Draft. We are sorry to inform you that the Federal Government of Nigeria had made it clear to all foreign contractors whose payment is overdue, to be paid immediately hence all the modality relating to the release of your contract fund had been completed. You are advised to stop any further communication with your local representative(s) any officials (s) department of the CBN or Union Bank or any Government parastatal. This is to forestall new effort towards a diversion of your payment. 
 
This office supersedes every other department in the CBN ,every other banks in Nigeria and correspondence bank abroad  and is thus responsible for the final payment. The consequences of not heeding to this warning would be yours.
 
Although we have been able to come up with some good result about the people that have extorted money from you illegally and i wish to list them so that you will personally indicate them by writting back because we want to make your payment to youwithout any delay but we must surely deal and bring this names to book if only you will indicate correctly any of them. 
 
The names of the Touts that have been arrested are as follows: 

1)Dr.ken in  U S A
2) PROF CHARLES SOLODO 
3) CHIEF JOSEPH SANUSI 
4)DR. R.RASHEED
