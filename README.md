# SMS-Spam-Detection-and-Classification
SMS Spam Detection and Classification Model to Combat Abuse in Telephone Networks Using BERT in conjunction with  Machine Learning Algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, etc
The model introduces a novel approach utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.
Data preprocessing techniques, such as stop word removal and tokenization, are applied, along with feature extraction using BERT.
Machine learning models, including SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, are integrated with BERT for differentiating spam from ham messages. 

Evaluation results revealed that the Na√Øve Bayes classifier + BERT model achieves the highest accuracy at 97.31% with the fastest execution time of 0.3 seconds on the test dataset. This approach demonstrates a notable enhancement in spam detection efficiency and a low false-positive rate.
